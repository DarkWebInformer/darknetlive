Our users post advertisements specifying their preferred method of payment e.g. bank transfer, cash, online payment processor like PayPal, gift cards, etc, other users reply to these advertisements, LocalMonero escrows the Monero from the user that is the Monero seller in a given trade and releases the Monero to the buyer when the seller confirms that they have received the payment from the buyer. LocalMonero can also step in to mediate any dispute that may arise.<br><span class="font-bold">How We Are Different </span><br>On LocalMonero you are dealing with humans. Unlike centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, you make a trade directly with another person. This makes the process lean and fast, as there is no corporate overhead. You get your Monero instantly. Also, LocalMonero can support every payment method its user community supports, making it possible for users without access to traditional banking to also be able to buy or sell Monero. For every transaction, LocalMonero offers escrow or transaction service to protect the buyer of Monero.Legalhttp://nehdddktmhvqklsnkjqcbpmb63htee2iznpcbs5tgzctipxykpj6yrid.onion/nojs/law-enforcement-inquiries<br><span class="font-bold">If you seek information from LocalMonero: </span><br>LocalMonero will comply with any duly issued subpoena served on us through the proper legal channels.
