As long as these conditions prevail it is necessary that the initiatory knowledge of the "Darknet Mysteries" and the history of things prior to the beginning of this cycle, or age, remain hidden. Secret organizations offering valid initiations according to a true and traditional doctrine are no more than a shadow when the spirit of knowledge no longer gives life to the symbols that are only an external representation of the bound to what is called the spiritual Center of the World. At such a time the loss of the tradition is felt, especially when the direct and supportive relationship with the spiritual center is lost. It is then, as we said previously, something that is hidden more than truly lost. It is not even hidden for all and some possess it entirely. This promises the possibility of others being able to find it if they desire. Each one seeks in their own way, directing their efforts in such a manner as to awaken to the harmonic vibration, according to the law of action and responding reaction, that puts them in spiritual communion with the Supreme Center. Agartha, it is said, was not always underground and will not always remain there. A time will come when those who live in the communities of Agartha will leave their caverns and return to the surface. Upon their disappearance from the visible world, they took the name Agartha, meaning &#38; ldquo;unreachable&#38; rdquo; or &#38; ldquo;inaccessible&#38; rdquo;, &#38; ldquo;inviolable&#38; rdquo;, because they found it convenient to establish their habitation of peace underground.
