We approached this a little different.Notes <br><span class="font-bold">Recruitment </span><br>The market is poaching Wall Street Market vendors. Not too unusual for a new marketplace. This is the message sent to WSM vendors:Dear [vendor username],<br><span class="font-bold">We wants you to introduce a new Bitcoin and soon a Monero multi-signature market also: Luna market. </span><br>What is LUNA and what are its advantages?Luna market is a marketplace with the primary focus on minimizing scam opportunities for vendors AND market admins while maintaining high usability, a &#38; ldquo;easy-to-use&#38; rdquo; payment system.What makes multi-sig better than regular escrow?<br>Since the funds are locked between two or three people it is impossible for the market or law enforcement to steal the funds out of escrow.For each order we offer &#38; ldquo;Locktime&#38; rdquo; transactions, ensuring that the vendor can retrieve his funds after 90 days should the market ever go down.If used right transactions in Escrow are insured against any losses.What is Locktime?In short: Locktime is a second transaction we provide the vendor with. Should Luna market go offline the vendor can still finalize the order with this transaction.This transaction only activates after 90 days of Escrow.NOTE: We will let our clients NOT downloading Locktime files, we will use a clipboard for each transaction to copy and paste the multi-signature locktime codes.I want to explain why we build this market.Hansa market only multi-signature was the only market what was the best for vendors and customers in my opinion and i would like to explain why.First of all i don&#38; rsquo;t see anything positive on the markets at this moment they all work with escrow systems and got all the coins in own hands, yes they all offer multi-signature transactions also except Dream market But because of the next reasons almost nobody is use it.- Its pointless to use Multi-signature on markets as Wallstreet because they NOT offering Locktimes on each Multi-signature transaction. That means if the market collaps the funds are lost.- Customers don&#38; rsquo;t know how Bitcoin Multi-signature works or they maybe lazy to search how it works and than choose a other vendor without Multi-signatureenough competition as vendor.When there is a market with only multi-signature, customers have no other option to study how it works and i am sure they realize very fast how it works.After 10minutes they will understand it or else we will have guides and a support desk to help.The markets what are now u can choose for FE option  if u pay 1000$ to markets as Wallstreet or got extremly much sales already, but the customers i did talk with don&#38; rsquo;t like that option and i am sure u will have a decrease of orders when u choose for that option.Because our site is only multi-signature FE is not required.In my opinion the markets what are now avaible play it smart to keep the coins in own hands for a big exit scamm.you build as vendor a customer network, maybe the market will grow and grow the next months if its not collapse but when the markets goes offline u will have big lose  its gambling but there are no right solutions untill now.At this moment maybe u got on Wallstreet market alot of money in transit, but maybe tomorrow its down and you will lose all the profit.This is just my story about how i think on the situation on all the markets.<br>The benefits of Luna market:- Since the funds are locked between two or three people it is impossible for the market or law enforcement to steal the funds out of escrow.For each order we offer &#38; ldquo;Locktime&#38; rdquo; transactions, ensuring that the vendor can retrieve his funds after 90 days should the market ever go down.<br>- Fast and polite support desk what in my opinion is important for a good market.<br>- In case the vendor have a negative feedback and its really unfair and the vendor did what he could, we can remove the feedback.<br>- After a dispute the customer can&#38; rsquo;t leave a negative feedback  so he can&#38; rsquo;t take revange<br>- Low Fee&#38; rsquo;s 3%.<br>- Monero Multi-signature payment system  In a few months <br>- Bitcoin Multi-signature payment system.<br>- Price updates each 15minutes, so the price will be topical.- Easy layout.- Cheap promotion costs.The team we work with have alot knowledge to keep the site safe and secure.<br>Luna market one time vendor fee:<br>Because the market is new we will give the first 30 vendors a free vendor badge.So my question is are u interested in joining us as vendor for free?If u have questions or idea&#38; rsquo;s for us please let me know.http://lunamarmge6dadag.onionSave the mirror links:http://cbx3tb32p5w6wlyj.onion<br>http://4rkg4nekiwfuukbf.onion<br>http://xicmpp6adwg3uftf.onion<br>http://d5ufjttkclhvtdvx.onionBest regards,Luna market<br><span class="font-bold">DeepDotWeb Slight of Hand </span><br>Luna Market is not on the DeepDotWeb marketplace list. Yet look at the footer&#38; rsquo;s similarity to WallStreetMarket&#38; rsquo;s footer. WSM is on the DeepDotWeb market list. Luna Market doesn&#38; rsquo;t claim to be on the market list, but I imagine the intent to mislead was not an oversight.Luna Market<br><span class="font-bold">Other </span><br>Despite the two above points that make the market seem a little shady, they do make good points. Multi-sig only has been pushed and promoted but hs not taken off.
