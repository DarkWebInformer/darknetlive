Here, anyone can obtain a seller account and put offer/offers for the community. All transactions are made through our secure Escrow system to ensure safety for buyers.Why do you use Alphabay/Empire Market layout?The main aim is to brings back old melodious memories. Alphabay was pretty neat and every vendor liked it. It broke our hearts when one of the Empire Market admin exitscammed ruining Alexandre Cazes work. His work made the life of vendors edurable and gave a prospective existence of everyone. We can not bring back Alphabay and Alexandre Cazes and we can&#38; #38; rsquo;t help our own nostalgic feelings for Alphabay, that&#38; #38; rsquo;s why we decided to use Alphabay Market layout. May his soul be resting in the heaven.RIP Alexander Cazez!Is it safe to use World Market?If your interest in darknet market extends to becoming a persistent DNM shopper you should be following more rigorous opsec. If youre a casual DNM shopper, however, and arent ordering your goods by the pound or kilo, dont much sweat it. To access the darknet, youll need the Tor web browser which must be configured correctly. You should never use JAVASCRIPT at any cost. World Market ensures your privacy and our database is encrypted. We follow best security preactices. We also have bug bounty program for the safety of our users.I am scammed need help, what can I do?When you log in to a darknet market for the first time, youre at a great risk of losing your bitcoin. Before you start popping pills into your shopping cart, however, take a close look at the vendor youre buying from. Most vendors are legit, and have no intention of scamming their customers, but dont trust  verify by checking their feedback. Bear in mind that a vendor with 100 four-star ratings is significantly more trustworthy than a vendor with five stars and three sales.Escrow is your friend, never finalise your order early, in case you&#38; #38; rsquo;ve not received your order. If you&#38; #38; rsquo;re already tricked, there is nothing much market can do, but if you report your scammer on time, maybe market will ban him and you might br refunded by confiscating vendor fundsDoes World Market sell anything?World Market offers a almost all of black market items that you can&#38; #38; rsquo;t find on a normal website. However prostitution, child porn and murder services/substances intent to kill or poison human/ weapons are not permitted.What currencies does World Market support?Bitcoin and MoneroWhat is the mnemonic?The mnemonic for your account is used for recovery purposes, its only displayed during registration.How does the PGP Work?Using PGP is very easy and so far, is the best encryption for Darknet users. The first time you try to use PGP also known as GPG, itll take you 15 minutes to install and successfully encrypt your first message to your darknet vendor. The second time will take you five minutes, the third time 60 seconds, and the fourth time youll be embarrassed at the thought of having ever communicated bareback on the darknet without PGP. Dont rely on darknet markets to encrypt on your behalf by ticking the request box upon submitting your order. It works with an asymmetric public and private key system: the sender encrypts the message using the intended recipient provided public key and only he can then decrypt it with his corresponding private key We strongly suggest you to use an offline, open source PGP tool like GPG.How can I know that I am using a real world market mirror?On every mirror you can go to /verify, if the link is real it will be signed by the market key. Make sure the signature matches the market key.Where can I buy Bitcoins or Monero?You can find plenty of methods and platforms in the clearnet to trade cryptocurrencies. We can suggest you to buy peer to peer using sites such as <a class="link" href="noreferrer%20nofollow%20noopener.html" target="_blank">https://localbitcoins.com/</a> or <a class="link" href="noreferrer%20nofollow%20noopener.html" target="_blank">https://localmonero.com/</a>, since you can often find more hassle free and private options here, expecially if you are new to the field. For learning how to use monero, you can check this website. <a class="link" href="noreferrer%20nofollow%20noopener.html" target="_blank">http://xmrguide42y34onq.onion</a>Who controls World Market?World Market is administrated by /u/MrWorld and /u/Lovelace. Both have been expert security professionals and highly technically brilliant to run a Darknet marketplace.Am I really Anonymous here?You&#38; #38; rsquo;re only anonymous is you&#38; #38; rsquo;re using a right setup. Always, use Tor, jabber, don&#38; #38; rsquo;t dox yourself and use privacy coins, such as monero.Can I delete my account?Accounts are deleted from our system if it has no activity over 1 month. Ofcourse we delete accounts if you request it.Do you offer referral system?No, World Market are only sharing referral system if we see you can provide us the necessary traffic. We don&#38; #38; rsquo;t do it to avoid vendors abusing it by linking their customers to their own referral to get their comissions payment back.What do you take on every transaction?We take for every transaction 4% as commission fee.Do I need to pay for withdraw?Yes, in order to have faster confirmation we require fixed withdraw fee to pay.How can I trust vendors?Most vendors are legit, and have no intention of scamming their customers, but dont trust  verify by checking their feedback. But youre also going to be greeted by a cornucopia of beguiling wares begging for your bitcoin. Check the feedbacks given by previous buyers and do more research. Always order from a vendor having high number of sales. Bear in mind that a vendor with 100 four-star ratings is significantly more trustworthy than a vendor with five stars and twenty sales.How can I become a vendor?Read the information on the BECOME A VENDOR page. You will need to follow the vendor rules and pay the vendor fee. Vendors are required to set up 2FA to secure their account. If you are caught scamming, padding feedback or breaking any other rule your vendor account will be revoked and you could be banned.What is FE Finalize Early or Escrow?Escrow is a arrangement to temporarily hold money for a transaction on their buyers and sellers behalf before the transaction has been finalized. When buyers make a purchase on our market, the money from their market wallet is deducted and immediately transferred to market escrow wallet.Finalize Early, is a similar payment system, however, in this process balance is transferred to vendors wallet much ado.How does escrow work for digital listings?Once you purchase the listing it will be marked as processing, the vendor has 24 hours to complete the order by sending the digital item then marking the order as shipped otherwise the order will be cancelled. Once the order has been marked as shipped the buyer can either finalize the order once they have received the purchase, dispute the order if there is a problem or extend escrow if required. If the buyer does nothing once the order is marked as shipped it will auto-finalize after being marked as shipped for 24 hours.How does escrow work for physical listings?Once you purchase the listing it will be marked as processing, the vendor has 72 hours to ship the order and mark the order as shipped otherwise it will be cancelled. Once the order has been marked as shipped the buyer can either finalize the order once they have received it, dispute the order if there is a problem or extend escrow if required. If the buyer does nothing once the order is marked as shipped it will auto-finalize after being marked as shipped for 14 days.Are all listings done through escrow?The only listings that are not done through escrow are listings by FE vendors. FE vendors are vendors that have been proven to be reliable and reputable.How can I get FEFinalize Early?A vendor can apply for FE once their vendor level reaches 5. The criteria for this is at least 250 sales, $25000 in volume and 90% positive feedback.How is the AutoShop different from listings?The AutoShop has no escrow, its intended to be a fast paced process. To ensure a card purchased off the AutoShop is live you can enable the checker during checkout, this will automatically cancel the order.Where is the PGP key for the market?The World Market PGP key is located at here<br><h2 class="mt-4" id="reviews">Reviews (27)<span class="text-sm ml-2">(Average Rating 2.1 / 5.0)</span></h2><hr/><div class="mt-4 text-sm space-y-2"><div class="comment" id="af40c010"><h4><span class="font-semibold">NaughtybyNature</span><span class="text-xs">2022-01-15</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span></div></h4><p>In a dispute with Vendor and Marketplace.

Sorry to bring this up here.but I am in total darkness.  I have been a customer of yours for some time.  For the past 2 weeks I have been unable to connect. I have managed to connect once or twice.  The problem is with the captcha.  It tells me that the captcha is not good. I stopped several times a day and I can try it 10 times and it's the same answer it seems to be going in circles.  I find this unfortunate because I had a very good service. I have tried another account and I am still stuck in the chat room because when the markert page opens there is no place where I can ask for help. I am very sorry to talk about this here but this is the only place I have found.  Even with this mishap it is the best market I have found and I have tried many.

Thanks
