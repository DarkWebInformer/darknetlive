On different servers instances, users can create so-called identities. These identities are able to communicate over the boundaries of the instances because the software running on the servers supports one or more communication protocols which follow an open standard. As an identity on the fediverse, users are able to post text and other media, or to follow posts by other identities. In some cases such as on Poast, users can even show or share data video, audio, text, and other files publicly or to a selected group of identities and allow other identities to edit other users&#38; rsquo; data such as a calendar or an address book.<br>- fetched from the <a class="link" href="noreferrer%20nofollow%20noopener.html" target="_blank">Fediverse Wikipedia article</a> Feb 8/2021A great video to watch to get a basic idea of the Fediverse is <a class="link" href="noreferrer%20nofollow%20noopener.html" target="_blank">Fixing Social Media for Good</a> posted by Luke Smith on Jan 13/2021We actively encourage anyone interested in joining Poast consider hosting their own instance for themselves and their friends to ensure the health of the fediverse as a whole.

This domain registration prevents third parties from seizing control of your domains by putting control directly into your crypto wallet, preventing any malicious actor from manipulating your domain.You can access ENSdomains by using Opera native support for IPFS sites so far or using a plugin called MetaMask, a third party wallet that supports DNS resolution with the ENS service. With MetaMask installed, you can simply visit the below URL which will take you to our TOR hidden service address to access Poastpoast.eth/ - keep in mind the trailing slash is required so MetaMask knows you are looking to resolve an ENSdomain!Open Source SoftwareSoapbox is free and open source FOSS software that runs atop a Pleroma serverThe Soapbox repository can be found at Soapbox-feThe Pleroma server repository can be found at Pleroma-beLast updated: Nov 1, 2021<br><h2 class="mt-4" id="reviews">Reviews (1)<span class="text-sm ml-2">(Average Rating 5.0 / 5.0)</span></h2><hr/><div class="mt-4 text-sm space-y-2"><div class="comment" id="4cb53247"><h4><span class="font-semibold">Mike</span><span class="text-xs">2023-05-29</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span></div></h4><p>Hshahahsnnsnz</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div></div></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
