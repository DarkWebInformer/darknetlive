A while later, he made this idea a reality with the creation of what is considered the first darknet marketplace; Silk Road, and with this the beginning of an era founded on libertarian principles which in fact did not pretend to be an utopia but it came very close. The end of Silk Road and all attacks against genuine free market has only spread on a global scale the existence of of darknet markets.<br><br>After Silk Road, there were more good markets, but it was not until Alphabay came to achieve a huge and varied market of different categories that the &#38; #8220; Dark Amazon&#38; #8221;  concept of having a large-scale anonymous market became a reality (lastest stats of Alphabay proves that since Alphabay, no other market has reached those numbers again in terms of vendors and listings).<br><br>We like how intuitive AlphaBay&#38; #8217; s interface is for buyer and vendors (specially we like how alpha02 added some unique features and how some of those features still cannot not be found on any other market). We improved lot of things and added some necessary changes). We do not believe that it is fair that the most friendly and intuitive layout that the darknet has ever seen be remembered in a bad way due to the exit scammed Empire market.<br><br>Excited and convinced with Ross&#38; #8217;  libertarian economic theory, which will be our guide for this great and long project, and in love with alpha02&#38; #8217; s intuitive interface, we decided to bring live the AlphaBay&#38; #8217; s layout with some improvements with the name of Abacus Market. We do not want to be another market more, time will prove it. We worked hard to code from scratch a complete platform with high standards. Over the time we will start implementing more unique features. This is going to be a long way to go, and we know that we are going to find difficulties, we have already found them to get where we are today, and we know more will come but we have love for this and the only thing we expect is Abacus to be of great help for all of you that believe in a free and anonymous market.<br><br>This is it. Before we could contribute with fresh and unique ideas to the darknet community, it was neccesary to look at the beggining of this freedom revolution.

We do not allow child pornography or any resources that might lead to, selling humans or their parts, services to harm other (physical or mental including assassination, threatening, arson, surveillance, harassment etc), fentanyl or analogues, poisons, selling guns, explosives or any items which may lead to any terroristic actions (some exceptions are tasers, pepper sprays), just to name a few.<br><br>Although probably the darknet community has never been as big as it is today, we do not see anymore the same enthusiasm or a solid community around markets like before. We want to extend our hand in a sign of friendship to all other markets like us, and the possibility of cooperating together to make the darknet an unified and united community for the freedom of all of us.

Today I wanted to make a deposit into the account that is always generated once by Abacus Market and was scammed.
The money never arrived even though all blockchain requirements were met.
I was subsequently told by my provider that the address was suddenly invalid. Abacus Support blamed me for supposedly missing an m in my deposit address. I compared the addresses with each other and yes, a letter was missing...but the deposit address generated for me by the Abacus system simply did not contain an m in this place after comparing it several times. I think that was just an excuse. You should only deposit money to the individually generated abacus deposit address...and only once. But as I said, nothing ever arrived and Abacus didn't refund me a cent even though I generated an incorrect BTC address. shame on Abacus
They are slowly starting to scam</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="5c87b92c"><h4><span class="font-semibold">Hannibal</span><span class="text-xs">2023-11-05</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span></div></h4><p>Be careful, be careful!!
Abacus Market is starting to cheat.
Incorrect, incomplete and invalid deposit addresses are being generated more and more often, leading to complete loss of money. Support then assigns the blame to the buyer. You are accused of not having copied the address correctly because letters are missing. Of course, I immediately checked the error assigned to me by support and found nothing because the same address was generated again and again. Support supposedly had a different address for the missing letter, which was correct. I was only told that after my money found itself in Nirvana. Because after generation, the system tells you to transfer bitcoins to the generated address. Because if the PGP decryption is successful you will see the supposedly correct BTC address. The support should be treated with caution. That's more and more true and nothing more...
Please pay attention!!!</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="01e774e0"><h4><span class="font-semibold">Silva</span><span class="text-xs">2023-11-29</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span></div></h4><p>I have information for sell how i can sell it ? </p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="96ce1bbb"><h4><span class="font-semibold">shooting star</span><span class="text-xs">2023-12-01</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span></div></h4><p>captcha prevents you from logging in while site admins steal ur money lol</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="52b964f3"><h4><span class="font-semibold">hpik</span><span class="text-xs">2023-12-29</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span></div></h4><p>why dose captcha not respect right answer</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="3f96a76a"><h4><span class="font-semibold">bouba star</span><span class="text-xs">2024-01-01</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span><span class="b"></span></div></h4><p>does it working now ?</p><div class="flex"><div class="flex-grow"></div></div></div><div class="comment" id="cfb39172"><h4><span class="font-semibold">glo1</span><span class="text-xs">2024-01-05</span><div class="flex-grow"></div><div class="score"><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span><span class="a"></span></div></h4><p>This market is scummy, I would not trust it.
