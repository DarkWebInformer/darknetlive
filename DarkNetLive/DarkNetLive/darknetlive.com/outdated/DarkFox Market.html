Darkfox Market will now be limited. This means the subdread is under dread staff moderation posts are manually approved until such a time where faith in the admin&#38; #38; #39;s competence is restored.  Let me outline the reasons behind this limitation.  Starting a couple months ago there was some reports of scammers running wild and trying to extort buyers. This for a growing market is common when the bond fee is relatively low and listing publishing has no review. Generally market admins get it sorted out when they clean out the scammers and organize the site more to protect the buyers and vendors.  That is not what happened here. What has happened is a nearly daily report of new buyers some with proof some without using darkfox market and not getting a successful transaction done. Disputes are not getting answered. If you look at /u/DarkFoxMarket&#38; #38; #39;s admin&#38; #38; #39;s profile his posting activity has really taken a dive. That is not to say he is completely inactive. Most of his recent activity is cleaning up this subdread from all the posts like /post/c60c58af5a58bf41c3bf /post/736224160d3bcb60f4db or /post/fe58f9de968cdb998f05 and then not doing anything to address them.  Recently there was a report from a reputable vendor WHO NEVER EVEN VENDED ON THE MARKET having a profile with the correct PGP key, full FE privileges, and over 20 sales. How the fuck in the world does that happen? And why does it take multiple days to get sorted?  After basically a full scrape of the site a few things came apparent. Old vendors who are now overall inactive or compromised are still left up, there is minimal disputes compared to the negative feedback, tons of enabled listings from vendors who are inactive for months sometimes over half a year, many MANY multiple multiple listings of the same thing at times only with a different image example see licarter *NOW BANNED*, lots of vendors but most has no history on other markets know recon has a limited set of history though.  Over two weeks ago I talked with darkfox&#38; #38; #39;s admin to see his perceptive. He said the market was getting targeted by a group of scammers and that is why all these things are happening. That there is automated spam creating waves of tickets and messages on the site. That there was automated vendor purchasing and listing creating happening with thousands of listings at first, but then they transitioned to lower listing counts. So I gave it time. Growing pains that will be fixed by a change in the bond amount, listing approval process, and checking image hashes so removed listings couldn&#38; #38; #39;t get re-uploaded kind of idea. A day or two worth of development work if that.  Almost a month past and yet I see no change. My disappointment is as high as I believe your distaste in me right now for making this post /u/DarkFoxMarket. But I do hope you understand why my hand was forced in this regard. When even a vendor starts to get pissed at you for letting scammers use his name you must know that you fucked up.  Let this be a growing fire under your ass. If people are automating their spam, work on a new captcha the irony is not lost on me I swear the dread update is coming so soon. Spend a day and clean up the listings. Disable vendors listings who are gone and are not coming back. Get it back on track to restore confidence that you can even get it back on track. You can get the faith in you back if you do some actions and communicate what is happening. The silent treatment is only getting people more and more pissed at you.  Simply put get your shit together man. Get it sorted or you simply won&#38; #38; #39;t be welcome here anymore. DarkFox Market is a innovative darknet market.

this market cheated me with more than $ 353 dollars
And no matter how much ticket I sent them, they never responded, they only closed the tickets without any explanation, they blocked the option of being able to withdraw the money from my account or buy and they never explained the reason and no matter how much I wrote to them, they never responded

A lot of vendors just taking their customers and going private. For carding and carding manuals my go to was earrlth protonmail com he was big on empire a few years ago and went private. Buy the manual, see if carding is for you then buy the fullz / cards if you want to take on the risk. The reward is very very nice, it gets addicting. Tell him glo sent you
