A review of the vendor's accounts on several markets, including ToRReZ, ASAP, Vice City, Bohemia, and Tor2Door, revealed that all the accounts had the same PGP key. The vendor also made direct deals via Wickr under the username "DrZhivagoEM." <br>During <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.540217/gov.uscourts.vaed.540217.2.0.pdf" target="_blank">the investigations</a>, the investigating agents made multiple undercover purchases of oxycodone and Xanax from MonPham via dark web marketplaces and Wickr.<br><img src="../images/undercover-purchases-bfeda468.html"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The undercover purchases</p><br>Blockchain analysis revealed that bitcoin sent to the vendor during the undercover purchases ended up in an account at an undisclosed exchange. Information acquired from the exchange revealed that the account was being accessed from an IP address associated with PenTeleData. Information from PenTeleData revealed that the IP address had been assigned to Bangurah.<br>The investigators set up surveillance at Bangurah's residence in August 2022. On August 24, Bangurah exited the residence carrying a backpack and the investigators followed him to a USPS collection box where he dropped off a package. The investigators retrieved the package, acquired a search warrant, and found that it carried 27 counterfeit oxycodone pills. The investigators contacted the package's intended recipient. The recipient revealed they had purchased Oxy from MonPham. The recipient also gave the investigators access to his account and they confirmed he had an order with MonPham that was awaiting delivery.<br>The investigators executed a search warrant at Bangurah's residence on August 31. The search resulted in the discovery of a fully equipped pill production laboratory in the laundry room. The investigators seized a commercial-grade pill press, a vacuum sealer, a commercial-grade<br>powder blender, and personal protective equipment. They also seized an undisclosed number of pills, electronic devices, and ledgers.<br><img src="../images/druglab-15294d09.html"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The lab</p><br>Conversations recovered from the electronic devices revealed that the family had been using fentanyl and other ingredients to manufacture the counterfeit pills.<br><img src="../images/conversation-8e35b65e.html"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">One of the conversations</p><br>Sales records recovered from the seized ledgers revealed that the trio had sold approximately 3,057 counterfeit oxycodone pills and 57,000 counterfeit Xanax pills. <br>On March 5, 2024, each of the defendants <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/pennsylvania-family-pleads-guilty-fentanyl-trafficking" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to distribute 40 grams or more of fentanyl.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
