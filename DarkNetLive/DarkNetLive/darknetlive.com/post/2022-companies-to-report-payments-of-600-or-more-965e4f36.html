The company broke down the changes as follows:<br><br><li><span class="font-bold"><span class="italic">1099-K Threshold Change:[/em]</span></li><br><li><span class="font-bold">This new Threshold Change is currently only for payments received for goods and services transactions, so this doesn’t include things like paying your family or friends back using PayPal or Venmo for dinner, gifts, shared trips, etc.</span></li><li>This change was introduced in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which amended some sections of the Internal Revenue Code to require Third-Party Settlement Organizations (TPSOs), like PayPal and Venmo, to report <span class="font-bold">goods and services</span> <span class="font-bold">transactions</span> made by customers with $600 or more in annual gross sales on 1099-K forms. Currently, a 1099-K is only required when a user receives more than $20,000 in goods and services transactions <span class="font-bold">and</span> more than 200 goods and services transactions in a calendar year.</li><br><li><span class="font-bold">[i]In-flow and Out-flow Reporting Changes[/em]</span></li><br><li>The In-flow and Out-flow Reporting Changes are currently only a legislative proposal, which could potentially be considered by Congress this year. The proposed change would ultimately require all banks and payment service providers, including PayPal and Venmo, to report total inflows and outflows for accounts with at least $10,000 of total deposits and/or withdrawals to the IRS. This is intended to increase the visibility the IRS has into money coming in and out of customer accounts.</li><li>At this stage, unlike the 1099-K Threshold Change, this is just a proposal and the details are still up for debate. As the situation changes, we’ll be sure to keep this updated as we learn more.</li><br><br>If a user transacted more than $600 in one year, the financial service is supposed to send them <a class="link" href="companies-to-report-payments-of-600-or-more-to-the-irs/documents/1099-k.html" target="_blank">a Form 1099-K</a> which PayPal described as “an IRS informational tax form used to report payments received by a business or individual for the sale of goods and services that were paid via a third-party network.”<br>There presumably will not be any changes to the lives of US citizens who file accurate tax information with the IRS.
