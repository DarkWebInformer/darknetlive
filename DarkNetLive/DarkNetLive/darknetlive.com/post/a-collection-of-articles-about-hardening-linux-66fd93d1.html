This article is intended to debunk these misunderstandings by demonstrating the lack of various, important security mechanisms found in other desktop operating systems and identifying critical security problems within Linux’s security model, across both user space and the kernel. Overall, other operating systems have a much stronger focus on security and have made many innovations in defensive security technologies, whereas Linux has fallen far behind.<br><br><a class="link" href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/guides/linux-hardening.html" target="_blank">Linux Hardening Guide</a> - madaidans-insecurities.github.io<br>Linux is not a secure operating system.

Our underlying hypothesis is that one can successfully model user behavior on the basis of user-invoked mouse movements. Our implemented system raises an alarm when the current behavior of user X, deviates sufficiently from learned “normal” behavior of user X. We apply a supervised learning method to discriminate among k users. Our empirical results for eleven users show that we can differentiate these individuals based on their mouse movement behavior with a false positive rate of 0.43% and a false negative rate of 1.75%. Nevertheless, we point out that analyzing mouse movements alone is not sufficient for a stand-alone user re-authentication system.<br><br><a class="link" href="list-of-security-and-privacy-articles/documents/keystroak-study.html" target="_blank">Feasibility of a Keystroke Timing Attack on Search Engines with Autocomplete</a> (pdf) - vmonaco.com<br>Many websites induce the browser to send network traffic in response to user input events. This includes websites with autocomplete, a popular feature on search engines that anticipates the user’s query while they are typing. Websites with this functionality require HTTP requests to be made as the query input field changes, such as when the user presses a key. The browser responds to input events by generating network traffic to retrieve the search predictions. The traffic emitted by the client can expose the timings of keyboard input events which may lead to a keylogging side channel attack whereby the query is revealed through packet inter-arrival times. We investigate the feasibility of such an attack on several popular search engines by characterizing the behavior of each website and measuring information leakage at the network level. Three out of the five search engines we measure preserve the mutual information between keystrokes and timings to within 1% of what it is on the host. We describe the ways in which two search engines mitigate this vulnerability with minimal effects on usability.<br><br><a class="link" href="list-of-security-and-privacy-articles/documents/usenix.html" target="_blank">What Are You Searching For?

As Tor is an overlay network, servers hosting hidden services are accessible both directly and over the anonymous channel. Traffic patterns through one channel have observable effects on the other, thus allowing a service’s pseudonymous identity and IP address to be linked. One proposed solution to this vulnerability is for Tor nodes to provide fixed quality of service to each connection, regardless of other traffic, thus reducing capacity but resisting such interference attacks. However, even if each connection does not influence the others, total throughput would still affect the load on the CPU, and thus its heat output. Unfortunately for anonymity, the result of temperature on clock skew can be remotely detected through observing timestamps. This attack works because existing abstract models of anonymitynetwork nodes do not take into account the inevitable imperfections of the hardware they run on. Furthermore, we suggest the same technique could be exploited as a classical covert channel and can even provide geolocation.<br><br><a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220324134410/https://caia.swin.edu.au/talks/CAIA-TALK-080728A.pdf" target="_blank">An Improved Clock-skew Measurement Technique for Revealing Hidden Services (pdf)</a> - caia.swin.edu.au<br><a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120522143952/http://people.cs.umass.edu/%5c~elisha/Papers/SkewMask - final version.pdf" target="_blank">SkewMask: Frustrating Clock Skew Fingerprinting Attempts</a> - people.cs.umass.edu<br>In this work we present and implement a simple scheme by which a machine can mask, or intentionally misrepresent, its clock skew, as a defense against fingerprinting by remote machines.
