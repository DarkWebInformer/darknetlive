The investigation that led to these charges began in April 2016. Investigators targeted firearm vendors on the darkweb as well as their customers.<br><img src="../images/p1-99058366.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Authorities seized what appears to be a P1/P38 and two boxes of 9mm ammunition.</p><br><br>One suspect, a 39-year-old from Lübeck, is accused of being a darkweb weapons vendor. A search of the suspect’s house resulted in the seizure of 855 rounds of ammunition, brass knuckles, a butterfly knife, and a prohibited laser. The investigation into the 39-year-old also led to the identification of two suspected customers.<br>Three suspects, a 65-year-old from Ludwigshafen, a 40-year-old from Bavaria, a 39-year-old from Schaumburg allegedly purchased weapons or ammunition from the suspected darkweb vendor.<br>A search of the 65-year-old’s house resulted in the seizure of one handgun, 265 rounds of ammunition, and brass knuckles. Investigators searched the 40-year-old’s residence and seized eight handguns, one rifle, 142 rounds of ammunition, and 80 so-called “pyrotechnic devices.” The search of the 39-year-old’s house resulted in the seizure of two handguns, one “shotgun” with a prohibited laser attachment, 99 rounds of ammunition, and unspecified weapon parts. The announcement also accused the suspected buyer of producing his weapons. (<span class="font-bold">DNL note</span>: the Frankenstein flare-gun-turned-shotgun might have tipped them off and the “weapons parts” likely included the AR-style pistol grip visible in the picture below.)<br><img src="../images/social-logo-18008933.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Amazingly, this shotgun is not available on shelves.</p><br><br>The spokeswoman for the Frankfurt customs investigation office:<br>“The successes of the investigation make it clear that the Darknet is not a legal vacuum. Anyone who commits crimes via the Darknet must expect to be identified and prosecuted at any time.”<br><br>The four suspects did not have permits for the sale, manufacture, and possession of weapons and ammunition. They were as a result charged by the public prosecutor’s offices in Lübeck, Frankenthal, Bückeburg, and Bamberg.<br>The 39-year-old defendant from the Schaumburg district has already been found guilty and was ordered to pay a fine of several thousand euros.<br>Criminal proceedings against the rest of the defendants are ongoing.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
