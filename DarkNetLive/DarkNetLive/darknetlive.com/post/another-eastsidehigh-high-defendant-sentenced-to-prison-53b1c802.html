The parties agreed to exchange $200,000 in Bitcoin in a wired hotel room. After Le had sent the Bitcoin to the address provided by the feds, the second postal inspector pretended to be having problems with his cellphone. He asked Le to open the wallet application on his phone and verify that the transaction had been completed. Le handed his unlocked phone to the postal inspector. After the postal inspector had possession of Le’s phone, postal inspectors and state police entered the room and detained Le.”<br><br>“After being advised of his rights per Miranda, Le voluntarily provided law enforcement officers with his password.”<br><br>“After detaining Le, other officers approached Pires’ Mercedes, which was still in the hotel’s parking lot. They detained Pires and asked him about the keys on his key ring. Pires identified one as the key to the office space in Stoughton. Other law enforcement officers executed a search warrant at the office space where they encountered McCall wearing a respirator.”<br><br><img src="../images/esh-wsm1-90427535.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">EastSideHigh on Wallstreet Market</p><br><br><a class="link" href="../first-eastsidehigh-defendant-pleaded-guilty-to-drug-charges/index.html" target="_blank">Le pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to manufacture, distribute and possess with intent to distribute MDMA, Ketamine, and Alprazolam.
