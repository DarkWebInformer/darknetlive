The guide lists money laundering, the purchase and sale of illicit products via darknet marketplaces, terrorism financing, scams, tax evasion, and ransomware as serious crimes enabled by cryptocurrency.<br>In the money laundering section of the guide, AUSTRAC noted that criminals use mixing services and privacy coins to launder money.<br>“Although conversion services and privacy coins operate outside of the traditional banking sector, blockchain analysis tools can be used to identify digital currency addresses connected to conversion services, creating an opportunity for financial service providers to identify transactions coming from or going to these services.”<br><img src="../images/debonked-39801899.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The report suggests that businesses avoid “de-banking” suspicious customers.</p><br><br>The most interesting part of the guide is the section on behavioral and financial indicators. Each listed indicator should trigger enhanced customer due diligence. If the digital currency exchange suspects a customer or transaction is linked to criminal activity, they must submit a Suspicious Matter Report to AUSTRAC.<span class="font-bold">General Indicators
