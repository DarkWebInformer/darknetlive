A phone number on the package led investigators to a mailbox where they observed former police officer Thomas James Booker, 27, dropping off packages. Erin Gold, 32, who worked as “an accountant and burlesque dancer,” apparently had a relationship with Booker. They lived together and co-owned properties.<br><img src="../../images/coca-05292817.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Cocaine seized during the investigation | SA Police</p><br><br>Police have not revealed how they made the connection between the identification of Booker and the underlinecost vendor account.<br>However, undercover law enforcement officers purchased drugs from underlinecost as a part of the investigation.

On the desk was a computer that was signed into the underlinecost account on a marketplace, according to the police.<br>Police later arrested Gold at her workplace.<br><img src="../../images/weed-96395084.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Marijuana seized during the investigation | SA Police</p><br><br>During a bail hearing, a prosecutor explained the discoveries made by police after searching the property:<br>“When police attended the address they found the pair sitting at a desk together in front of a computer with an open TOR session, which is access to the dark web, open into the vendor account of Underline Costs with a list of unfilled orders. There were drugs seized at that location, including a commercial quantity of LSD and trafficable quantities of cocaine, cannabis, and MDMA. Those items were on the table in front of them. Some of them had been divided into smaller quantities ready for delivery. Also on the table in front of them packaged ready to be shipped in Australia Post packages. There was also a ledger book, which appeared to be a record of every sale including the amount and tracking number. It appears this was all run as a business. Police estimate they were turning over about $25,000 a day.”<br><br><img src="../../images/recon-17136046.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Steroids seized during the investigation | SA Police</p><br><br><span class="font-bold">Assets </span><br><br>A raid at the house belonging to Booker and Gold resulted in the seizure of $350,000.<br>A locked box at the Public Trustee’s office belonging to Booker contained $460,000.<br>Police froze $900,000 in cryptocurrency.

She was not at that location when the arrest occurred. Ms. Gold was arrested at her workplace where she was undergoing full-time employment. In my submission, her connection to Mr. Booker is the basis for her being charged.”<br><br>Her bail application was adjourned until later this month.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
