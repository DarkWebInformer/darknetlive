The package was addressed to the suspect’s apartment in Vienna’s 17th district. After opening an investigation into the recipient, the Customs Office investigators learned that the intended recipient had ordered drugs from <a class="link" href="../tags/darkweb-vendors/index.html" target="_blank">a darkweb vendor</a> on at least two separate occasions in addition to the seized package of 600 grams of marijuana. They knew this because they had recently seized two packages of marijuana that had also been shipped to the 22-year-old.<img src="../images/austrian-weed1-03640517.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A Picture of the Seized Marijuana | LPD Vienna</p><br>Police in Vienna, working with investigators from the Customs Office, identified the suspect.
