The duo's drug trafficking operation allegedly distributed drugs worth at least 130,000 euros. The drugs sold by the duo included 5 kilograms of amphetamine, 2.5 kilograms of cannabis, 120 grams of cocaine, as well as undisclosed quantities of MDMA, LSD, and ketamine. The cops are investigating 40 people suspected of purchasing drugs from the duo.<br>On being questioned, the 22-year-old reportedly told the cops that the duo had been purchasing the drugs they were distributing from the 39-year-old.<br>The investigators consequently executed a search warrant on the 39-year-old's residence. The search resulted in the seizure of undisclosed drugs. On being interviewed, the 39-year-old told the investigators that he had been importing, using, and reselling drugs he purchased through the <a class="link" href="../markets.html" target="_blank">dark web</a>. The suspect was, however, not arrested.<br>Further investigations revealed that the 39-year-old  had not stopped buying drugs from the dark web even though he knew he was under investigation. The investigators subsequently executed a search warrant on his residence on January 23, 2023. The search resulted in the seizure of more drugs and the <a class="link" href="../tags/Arrested.html" target="_blank">arrest</a> of the 39-year-old.<br>The Linz public prosecutor's office believes the 39-year-old ordered and resold a total of approximately 18 kilograms of cannabis, 3,000 LSD trips, 3.6 kilograms of cocaine, and 900 ecstasy tablets. The suspect's drug trafficking operation went on for more than a decade.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
