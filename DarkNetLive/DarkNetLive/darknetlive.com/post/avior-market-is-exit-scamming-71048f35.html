In early May, the creator of the market wrote that he had sold the market to a friend and that the friend is responsible for the ongoing exit scam.<br>KingArcherTheMagnificent (aka PrivateArcherAnthony and another dozen aliases), the creator of Avior, posted the below message in a thread titled “<a class="link" href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/cdf0f290a64b0f81b7b2" target="_blank">Warning: Avior Market is exit scamming</a>.”<br>Hello Everyone,<br><br>So as many of you know I ran avior for about 8 months and decided to offically sell it to one of my mates who i thought I could trust. But yes, it is true the new admin is locking every vendor out and has deleted most of the avior accounts including my main which i actually gave him I didn’t expect it to go this early with over 30,000 users I thought it could live on much more. I warn all users to not deposit nor use the site as the new admin has fully taken over everything and is trying to cash out as much as possible.<br><br>I must admit, Avior was somewhat of a mess that is why i assumed he did so. Even though he is very rich and could’ve made avior way bigger he has decided to not put any of the work in and take a shortcut.<br><br>I wanna apologize to everyone who has lost funds in this process, I wanna say I’m sorry I could not continue running avior. It was a mess which now ended even worse then it started. It got too much at one-point and I wanted to focus more on family so i figured selling it to my mate was a good option but I am clearly wrong.<br><br>Users are skeptical of the claim made by KingArcherTheMagnificent (Archer) that passed some of the blame to an unidentified party. Users have no reason to believe the statement is true.<br>It appears as if some of the claims made by the (former?) Avior administrator only hours before the above message directly contradict the transfer of ownership story. One comment, posted in a thread titled “<a class="link" href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/e01ce242ddfe796db0c6" target="_blank">Avior was sold and vendors are now locked out</a>,” explicitly denies these claims. <a class="link" href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/e01ce242ddfe796db0c6/#c-900ceee5209a556da6" target="_blank">The Avior administrator wrote</a>, “This is completely false. I am still in full control of Avior.”<br>True or not, the result of the exit scam for the few Avior users who had money sitting in escrow is exactly the same.<br>It seems unlikely that someone with money would spend between $15,000 and $20,000 * on an insignificant marketplace. To Archer’s credit, there is <span class="italic">some</span> evidence that Archer had approached other market administrators about selling the market. DNL has no evidence that any sale actually transpired. The Avior creator also has a history of selling his creations. Before Avior, Archer created the Tape news site as well as a number of similar services.<br>On April 1, Archer wrote:<br>I don’t own tape anymore mate, that’s why no stories are posted by “PrivateAnthonyArcher” Anymore, It was sold to hotmilk months ago take it up with him as i have nothing to do with tape.<br><br>The part of Archer’s comment that described the mechanics of the exit scam seem accurate, however. The market’s subdread is filled with posts from vendors about account lockouts.<br>[img=]Posts about the exit scam on the Avior subdread[/img]<br><br>And finally, Dread administrator Paris stickied a post titled “<a class="link" href="http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/post/bff14227e10155c99575" target="_blank">Avior Is Now Marked As EXITED</a>” in the Avior subdread. The post refers to the red warning in the subdread’s sidebar that reflects the current status of the market. Paris wrote, “Let this be a lesson to all market admins. Someone you might think is good to take over might very well crash the ship you built.”<br>OnionTree.org has <a class="link" href="https://oniontree.org/services/aviormarket.html" target="_blank">marked Avior as “dead”</a> and Onion.Live has <a class="link" href="https://onion.live/site/avior-market" target="_blank">added a similar warning</a> on their platform.<hr><br>* At least one market administrator verified that the owner of Avior had offered to sell the market for no more than $20,000. back<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
