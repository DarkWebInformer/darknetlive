He spoke about the limitations in child pornography investigations, the victims of these crimes, and the changes needed in punishing child pornography law violations.<br>He said some things likely overlooked by the general public and controversial to others:<br><br><li>He questioned the use of investigative techniques employed in the operations that brought down Playpen, The Love Zone, and Childs Play.</li><li>He agreed that laws needed changing when it came to child pornography cases, but that there was a “good reason” German Police could not upload their own child pornography.</li><li>He says that the majority of the victims are young women.</li><li>He said traveling sex tourists and pedophiles who remotely control child abuse are concerns.</li><li>He said that many young people willingly send naked photos of themselves in exchange for payment, “unaware of the dangers…”</li><li>That law enforcement needed a preventative approach when handling pedophiles.</li><br><span class="font-bold"><span class="italic">“Pedophilia can not simply be turned off by police and law enforcement.” –&nbsp;Wenz</span></span><br><br>Below is direct translation&nbsp;<a class="link" href="https://m.mainpost.de/ueberregional/politik/zeitgeschehen/Wie-deutsche-Ermittler-gegen-Paedophile-im-Internet-vorgehen;art16698,9951971" target="_blank">from Main Post</a>:<br><span class="font-bold">Question: Can the fight against child pornography be won on the internet?</span><br><span class="font-bold">Matthias Wenz:</span>&nbsp;Child pornography platforms have meanwhile almost completely migrated to non-public accessible areas of the Internet,&nbsp;<a class="link" href="../tags/darknet-markets.html" target="_blank">the so-called Darknet</a>.&nbsp;There, many of the perpetrators feel relatively safe.&nbsp;But they are not.&nbsp;Today, we are much better staffed and technically better off than just a few years ago.&nbsp;This is also shown by our great investigative successes, including the strike against the pedophile network Elysium last year.&nbsp;In addition, international law enforcement cooperation has improved. (And they&nbsp;<a class="link" href="german-police-bust-darknet-child-abuse-site/index.html" target="_blank">recently ended Tabooless Chat</a>&nbsp;and another sexual abuse forum they have not publicly announced.)<br><span class="font-bold">The FBI and many other foreign law enforcement agencies have more powers in covert investigations than the BKA.&nbsp;Is Germany a safe country for pedophiles on the Internet?</span><br><span class="font-bold">Wenz</span>: No!&nbsp;It is true that some of our foreign partners may themselves upload child pornography material to their covert investigations in order to gain the confidence of the perpetrators.&nbsp;That is not allowed in Germany, and there are good reasons for that.&nbsp;That’s why sometimes we do not get on with our investigation.&nbsp;Whether the powers of the investigators should be extended, however, is a question that must answer the policy, not us.&nbsp;But even with our current capabilities, we can effectively target pedophiles on the Internet.<br><span class="font-bold">Who are the perpetrators, who are the victims of child pornography?</span><br><span class="font-bold">Wenz</span>: The perpetrators are mostly men.&nbsp;They come from all walks of life.&nbsp;Among them are Hartz IV recipients, employees, police officers, priests, prosecutors, engineers and paediatricians.&nbsp;The victims are mostly female and sometimes very young.&nbsp;In some cases, even infants are abused immediately after birth.&nbsp;Abuse sometimes involves severe physical violence.&nbsp;Among the pedophile criminals are also so-called “traveling sex offenders” who search abroad for their victims – for example, Southeast Asia – and pay accordingly for the abuse on the spot.&nbsp;In addition, there are also pedophiles who remotely control the misuse of a child via livestreams and webcams.<br><span class="font-bold">The Philippines is a hotspot for the sexual exploitation of minors on the Internet.&nbsp;Are German children at risk too?</span><br><span class="font-bold">Wenz</span>: Yes.&nbsp;This is shown by our investigation successes in Germany, even though the commercial sexual exploitation of children and adolescents on the Internet happens fortunately only rarely here.&nbsp;However, parents should pay attention to how their children use smartphones and computers.&nbsp;Although most parents can not imagine: There are many teenagers who send nude pictures of themselves and are paid for it, for example, with Amazon vouchers.&nbsp;Many adolescents are unaware of the dangers that come with it and how they can be blackmailed.<br><span class="font-bold">Can the sexual abuse of children be resolved by investigation and punishment alone?</span><br><span class="font-bold">Wenz</span>: No.&nbsp;Pedophilia can not simply be turned off by police and law enforcement.&nbsp;That’s why we need a holistic, preventive approach.&nbsp;At the Berlin Charité, for example, there is the program “Do not become a culprit”.&nbsp;It addresses people who see themselves as endangered.<hr><br>On another note, to anyone out there researching these types of forums and sites on the darknet, the BKA website warns researchers should not conduct “their&nbsp;own research, since pages that contain child pornography may already be punishable by downloading [them].”<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
