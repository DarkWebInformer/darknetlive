The increase in sales has made Canada the fourth largest distributor of cannabis on dark web marketplaces. Public Safety Canada published the report.<br>To determine the implications of the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada on the distribution of cannabis on dark web marketplaces by Canadian vendors, the researchers (David Décary-Hétu, Masarah Paquet-Clouston, Martin Bouchard, and Carlo Morselli) analyzed sales made before and after the legalization.

Since 2011, criminal entrepreneurs have taken advantage of anonymous online marketplaces, called cryptomarkets. These platforms facilitate transactions of illegal products and services among many sellers and buyers, leveraging sophisticated technologies, like the Tor network and cryptocurrencies, to ensure anonymity among all participants. Illicit drugs are the most common products sold on cryptomarkets, but other goods and services are also offered, such as stolen financial information and counterfeit products. Cryptomarkets represent a low-risk environment where transactions can take place in an organized manner. The main objective of this report is to understand the illicit cannabis trade by Canadians on cryptomarkets, particularly since very little is known on cryptomarkets at a national level beyond a handful of studies providing fragmented results. This analysis is crucial at a time when the sale of recreational cannabis has been legalized in Canada with the objective of eliminating the black market for recreational cannabis. An examination of trends in cryptomarket sales as cannabis has become legal is an essential step towards understanding the impact of the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada. To reach the main objective, this project drew from two data sources: the DATACRYPTO software tool and a cryptomarket drug dealer survey. We find that, following the legalization of cannabis, sales of cannabis on cryptomarkets by Canadian dealers appear to show an upward trend. The noted increase is mainly related to sales targeting an international market. When comparing July 2018 to November 2018 sales, Canada moves from 8th to 4th position in terms of cannabis sales on cryptomarkets. It should be noted that the analyses presented in this report are exploratory as the follow-up period post-legalization was extremely short and the data are sparse. These results could change in the long-term, when the legal supply of recreational cannabis is more firmly established, and the legal market has matured.<br><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
