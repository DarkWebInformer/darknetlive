According to <a class="link" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210612000159/https://decisia.lexum.com/nsc/nssc/en/item/498297/index.do" target="_blank">court records</a>, a law enforcement officer with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) saw a user on an undisclosed darkweb site “looking to purchase a firearm.”<br>An HSI Special Agent posed as a weapons vendor and contacted the user. The user, who went by the username “kilo902kilo902,” told the undercover LEO that he lived in Halifax and wanted to purchase and import a pistol. The user later agreed to pay $2,150 for a Glock 19, magazines, and 50 rounds of ammunition. He sent the payment in Bitcoin to the undercover agent on December 24, 2020.<br>The HSI subsequently contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and made arrangements for controlled delivery of the pistol to the buyer. The RCMP conducted an investigation that linked Kapsalis to the “kilo902kilo902” username.<br>On January 27, 2021, an undercover RCMP officer delivered a Glock 19, two 15-round magazines, and ammunition to Kapsalis at a pre-determined location. Officers arrested Kapsalis after he took possession of the pistol and ammunition.<br>Kapsalis pleaded guilty to charges that stemmed from the attempted purchase of a firearm as well as charges from July 2019. On July 25, 2019, law enforcement officers searched Kapsalis’ house for reasons unrelated to the most recent charge. During the search, officers found a loaded shotgun, digital scales, shotgun shells, rifle rounds, two phones, more than 48 grams of cocaine, and two bags with a total of 766 grams of an unknown white powder.<br>Justice Joshua Arnold sentenced Kapsalis to five years in prison. Kapsalis will also provide authorities with a DNA sample and remain under firearms prohibition for life.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
