On April 19, 2022, mixers received “an all-time high of $51.8 million worth of cryptocurrency.” A chart provided by Chainalysis reveals that mixers received roughly $24 million worth of cryptocurrency on the same day in 2021.<br><img src="../images/by-mixer-source-90766340.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500"></p><br><span class="font-bold">“Are Mixers Compliant?” </span><br>In the report, Chainalysis laments that mixers are legal “despite their utility for criminals.” FinCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, clarified in 2020 that cryptocurrency mixers are considered money transmitters under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and must comply with the same regulations as other money transmitters. These regulations include maintaining an anti-money laundering compliance program and following “Know Your Customer” (KYC) rules for Money Services Businesses (MSBs).<br>“Given that increased privacy is the whole point of using a mixer, it seems unlikely that one could implement those compliance procedures and retain its user base. “<br><span class="font-bold">Types of Transactions </span><br>So far, in 2022, 23% of funds sent to mixers came from a cryptocurrency address associated with illicit activity.
