The majority of the respondents say cryptocurrency will advance our financial system in a positive way but also acknowledge that it plays a role in many of their criminal investigations.*Cryptocurrency spans all forms of criminal activity. At both the federal and state &amp; local levels, respondents told Chainalysis that cryptocurrency is prevalent in various crime types, including narcotics, fraud, theft, and cybercrime.*Blockchain analysis tools must provide accurate data and transaction visualization above all else. Respondents pointed to accurate, reliable blockchain data and simple visualization as the most critical components of any blockchain analysis tool they use. These functionalities matter for both completing investigations and for ensuring positive results in court.*Training matters. Respondents rated effective training programs as another crucial requirement for any cryptocurrency investigative tool they purchase*Public sector employees need more resources. 74% of our respondents said employees at their agency aren’t currently well-equipped to investigate cryptocurrency-related crime.[/list]&lt;h2 id="respondents-current-thoughts-and-attitudes-toward-cryptocurrency"&gt;Respondents’ current thoughts and attitudes toward cryptocurrency &lt;/h2&gt;<br>Respondents agree that cryptocurrency is relevant to their investigations and that their agencies should dump resources into investigating cryptocurrency crimes.

That’s a huge problem not just today, but in the future as well. Cryptocurrency is a rapidly changing industry — in just the last two years, for instance, we’ve seen a huge shift in activity from centralized services to DeFi protocols, where transactions are more complex and difficult to investigate — so if agencies aren’t becoming proficient in cryptocurrency investigations now, their knowledge gaps could compound, causing them to fall further behind <span class="font-bold">[em]the criminals exploiting cryptocurrency[/em]</span> regularly.”<br><br><img src="../images/well-armed-militia-52304257.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">74% said that their agency isn’t well-equipped to investigate cryptocurrency-related crime.</p><br>&lt;h2 id="cryptocurrency-investigations-today"&gt;Cryptocurrency investigations today &lt;/h2&gt;<br>More than half of the respondents see more than ten cryptocurrency-related cases per year, 38% see more than 20, and 14% see more than 100.<br><img src="../images/how-many-cases-26095822.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">There is a wide range in the number of cryptocurrency-related cases respondents see on the job</p><br><br>Scams and fraud are the most common types of cryptocurrency-related crimes seen by respondents.
