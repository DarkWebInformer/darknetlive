The users either paid with Bitcoin or Ethereum or they contributed by uploading “own made material” that had to “portray real sexual violence” to be accepted as payment and added to the DarkScandals content.

It is a special kind of evil to prey on and profit from the pain of others. Criminals should know if you leave a digital footprint, we will find you. If you exploit our children, we will put you behind bars. If you thought you were anonymous, think again. The dark web is not quite as dark today due to the hard work of IRS-CI and our partner agencies.”<br><hr>Europol Announcement <br><a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200313112040/https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/dark-web-child-abuse-administrator-of-darkscandals-arrested-in-netherlands" target="_blank"><span class="font-bold">DARK WEB CHILD ABUSE: ADMINISTRATOR OF DARKSCANDALS ARRESTED IN THE NETHERLANDS</span></a><br>In an international case, the Dutch Police (Politie), the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD), Dutch National Prosecutor’s office (Openbaar Ministerie), US authorities (Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security Investigations, Department of Justice), the German Federal Criminal Police (Bundeskriminalamt) and Europol cooperated in an operation that led to the arrest of the administrator, and the takedown of the website DarkScandals.

DarkScandals began operating about 2012 and boasted over 2,000 videos and images and advertised that it offered “real blackmail, rape and forced videos of girls all around the world.” DarkScandals offered users two ways to access this illicit and obscene content, which was delivered in “packs” via email for customers to download. Users could either pay for the video packs using cryptocurrency, or upload new videos to add to the content of the DarkScandals sites. Specific rules for the video uploads to the sites included “real rape/forced” content, and stated a preference for “own made material.” The site specifically forbade “fake, amateur…or acted movies,” rejecting content if it did not portray real sexual violence. The arrested administrator allegedly received almost 2 million dollars from selling this obscene and illicit content.<br><br>In addition to the arrest in the Netherlands, the administrator of DarkScandals was also indicted by a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia, USA for his operation of DarkScandals.
