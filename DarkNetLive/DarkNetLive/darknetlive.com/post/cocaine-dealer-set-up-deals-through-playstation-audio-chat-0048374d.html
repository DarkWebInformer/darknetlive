The owner of the account, Curtis Alexander, allegedly used the account as a platform through which he advertised significant quantities of cocaine.<br>An unidentified informant told the FBI that Alexander had been offering cocaine to other PlayStation users at the price of $34,000 per kilogram. “Alexander likely believes that audio communication during the course of his participation in an online game is secure,” FBI Special Agent Ben Brousil wrote <a class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6565970-PlayStation-Seach-Warrant-Application.html" target="_blank">in the warrant application</a>. “As such, Alexander likely believes that he can use audio communication during game play on the PlayStation to arrange the details of a drug transaction, similar to Alexander’s use of PlayStation Messaging to conduct drug transactions.”<br><br>Some PlayStation users are <a class="link" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbi-asked-sony-for-data-on-user-who-allegedly-used-playstation-network-to-sell-cocaine.156771/#post-27021362" target="_blank">discussing the games used by Alexander</a> as part of his alleged drug trafficking operation.<br>The informant worked alongside the FBI during the investigation into the suspected cocaine dealer.
