Undercover purchases revealed that the vendor operated out of Arizona. Investigators found that Medina and one of his co-conspirators had purchased postage at a USPS self service kiosk (SSK). Surveillance footage revealed that one of the people purchasing postage for packages associated with the vendor account was a “Hispanic male with a bard and goatee” who appeared to be between the ages of 20 and 30.

The petition claims that Medina is serving “a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for a alleged non violent drug offense” at an institution in Arizona.

The following historical information was found for “Ghost831” on SR:<br><br><br><li>Registered: October 17, 2012.</li><li>Last Seen: September 22, 2013.</li><li>Private “sent” messages show “Ghost831” was selling Oxycodone.</li><li>“Ghost 831” identified his location as being in Arizona.

The research identified a male individual with the name of JACOB MATTHEW MEDINA (MEDINA). Analysts obtained a booking photo of MEDINA and visually compared the booking photo and his Arizona driver’s license photo with the SSK photos obtained of the male mailer on December 4, 2018. The comparison revealed the mailer to be MEDINA.<br><br>Investigators found Facebook profiles for Medina and the second defendant.

Postal Inspector Brandon logged into NFusion and the Dream Market and sent Ghost831 a message inquiring about the purchase.

Postal Inspector Brandon provided the information and Ghost831 stated, “I believe yours is in route ill check later today? "<br><br>On December 31, 2018, Postal Inspector Brandon sent Ghost831 another message inquiring about the purchase.
