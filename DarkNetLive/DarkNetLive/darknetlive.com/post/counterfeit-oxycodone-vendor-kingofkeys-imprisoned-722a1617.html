McKernan also sold the pills via Wickr and Signal under the usernames "magicboy27" and "KofK" respectively.<br>According to <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.531938/gov.uscourts.vaed.531938.2.0.pdf" target="_blank">court documents</a>, FBI investigators first came across the KingofKeys vendor profile on Vice City in May 2022. The vendor joined the market in August 2021 and had completed 139 orders.<br>In May 2022, the investigators made two undercover purchases from the vendor, the first one via <a class="link" href="../markets/Vice%20City.html" target="_blank">Vice City</a> and the second one through Wickr. In both cases, the investigators received USPS priority mail envelopes that carried light blue pills placed inside multiple mylar bags. The pills had "M" and "30" stamped on the sides and tested positive for fentanyl.<br>Information acquired from USPIS revealed that the shipping labels used on the packages had been purchased from a PostNet in Scottsdale. <br>On being questioned, the PostNet employee turned witness revealed that the packages had been mailed by a '20 something man going by the name Johnny.' The employee also had the mailer's email address: [email]<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a5cfcacdcbdcc6c4d6cdcd979292e5d5d7cad1cacbc8c4ccc98bc6cac8">[email&#160;protected]</a>[/email]. The email address was associated with McKernan's name.<br>Fingerprint analysis on one of the packages revealed that four fingerprints found on the envelope were a match to McKernan. Arizona DMV records gave the investigators access to McKernan's address.<br>Next, the investigator decided to place an order from the vendor through Signal. The vendor contacted the investigators via the KofK Signal account. The vendor had linked the account to a phone number.<br>Information acquired from Coinbase revealed that there were two accounts associated with McKernan. The first account was registered under [email]<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="13797c7b7d6a7072607b7b2124245363617c677c7d7e727a7f3d707c7e">[email&#160;protected]</a>[/email] and McKernan's home address.
