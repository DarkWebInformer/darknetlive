The conspirators purchased kilogram quantities of fentanyl on the darkweb, created fake oxycodone pills with a pill press, and then resold the pills both locally and on the darkweb.<br>According to court documents 29-year-old <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdpa/pr/bloomsburg-man-sentenced-13-years-imprisonment-drug-trafficking" target="_blank">Brett Trageser pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent distribute 400 grams or more of fentanyl between October 2015 and May 2017. Trageser reportedly played a major role in the distribution of fentanyl pills manufactured by the ring leader, 34-year-old Nathan Anthony Ott of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.<img src="../images/dea-seized-pills-min-83205671.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Counterfeit Oxycodone Pills Seized by the DEA | DEA</p><br>At the beginning of the drug trafficking operation, Ott obtained <a class="link" href="dea-warns-of-counterfeit-pills-made-with-fentanyl/index.html" target="_blank">kilogram quantities of fentanyl</a> on the darkweb and used a manual pill press to make fentanyl pills. Ott then sold the fentanyl pills locally in Chambersburg. As the operation grew Ott recruited Trageser and the other members of the ring to help in distributing the pills. Unable to keep up with demand the ring reportedly purchased a motorized press capable of making 5,000 pills an hour. In March 2017 the ring moved the drug trafficking operation to an undisclosed <a class="link" href="../darknet-market-list/index.html" target="_blank">darkweb marketplace</a> and started distributing the pills throughout the US and other parts of the world. They used the United States Postal facilities in Chambersburg and surrounding areas to mail the drugs to their darkweb buyers.<br>The ring’s darkweb operation came to an end on May 10, 2017, when law enforcement raided Ott’s home. The raid led to the seizure of two pill presses, packaging and distribution materials, 18,000 fentanyl pills, and powder suspected to be fentanyl. The cops also seized computers and other electronic devices used to facilitate the distribution of the drugs. Ott, Trageser and their co-conspirators were subsequently arrested and charged.<br>On June 27, 2018, <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdpa/pr/franklin-county-man-sentenced-over-seventeen-years-imprisonment-conspiring-distribute" target="_blank">Ott was sentenced to 210 months</a> in prison after he pleaded guilty in July 2017 to conspiring to distribute fentanyl in Chambersburg between October 2015 through May 2017.
