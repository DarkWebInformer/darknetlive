The couple fulfilled over 1,000 orders and distributed large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, and counterfeit oxycodone pills through the vendor accounts.<br>The couple's arrest stemmed from an investigation launched in November 2021 against the SafeServe vendor profile. During the investigation, the investigators made multiple undercover purchases from the vendor. The purchases revealed that the vendor shipped from Phoenix.<br><img src="../images/undercover-purchases-582b11c8.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The undercover purchases</p><br>The investigators found the mailer's fingerprints on a drug package they ordered in early February 2022. Further investigations revealed that the fingerprints belonged to Taylor.<br>The investigators then established that Taylor was a close associate of three suspected darknet vendors based in Phoenix.<br>When questioned, one of the suspects told the investigators that they had taught Taylor and his boyfriend, Fischer, how to run a dark web vendor's account.

Surveillance footage at the post office showed that she placed five packages into a mailbox.<br>The investigators seized the packages and opened one of the packages after receiving permission from its intended recipient. The investigators found out that it had been packaged in the same way as the drug packages they had received from SafeServe. They found an undisclosed quantity of meth inside the package.<br>The <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/two-darknet-vendors-plead-guilty-trafficking-fentanyl-and-other-illegal-drugs" target="_blank">couple pleaded guilty</a> on August 25, 2023.
