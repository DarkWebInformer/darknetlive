They sent a portion of the funds to multiple accounts at the now-defunct dark web marketplace, AphaBay. From AlphaBay, the funds were sent to accounts under fictitious names in a US-based cryptocurrency exchange. From the exchange, the funds were moved through multiple platforms and addresses before ending up in accounts registered to either Lichtenstein and Morgan or their shell companies at multiple crypto exchanges.<br><img src="../images/laundering-scheme-2336fa98.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">How the couple moved the stolen funds</p><br>In most cases, Lichtenstein and Morgan sold the crypto and withdrew the funds into bank accounts under their control.  In other cases, they cashed out through bitcoin ATMs or by purchasing prepaid gift cards. In one instance, Lichtenstein purchased gold coins and had them shipped to his home address.<br>In 2021 the investigators acquired a search warrant for an email address linked to Lichtenstein's account on one of the crypto exchanges. The cloud storage of the account contained encrypted files. The investigators managed to decrypt some of the files on January 31, 2022.<br>One of the files contained a list of 2,000 addresses and their corresponding private keys. The addresses were the recipients of  the 119,754 bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex. The investigators seized a total of approximately 94,636 bitcoin from the addresses.<br>The account also had a spreadsheet, with the login credentials to accounts at multiple crypto exchanges. Most of the accounts had received the stolen funds. Litchsten had labeled the accounts as either frozen or emptied. <br>Litchsten also kept a folder with the IDs and personally identifiable information of numerous individuals. He also maintained a list of darknet ID vendors.<br>The couple <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/two-arrested-alleged-conspiracy-launder-45-billion-stolen-cryptocurrency" target="_blank">was arrested</a> on February 8, 2022. The government has reportedly seized an additional $475 million since the couple's arrest.<br>Morgan <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/bitfinex-hacker-and-wife-plead-guilty-money-laundering-conspiracy-involving-billions" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to one count each of money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States. She faces a maximum of five years in prison for each charge. <br>Lichtenstein pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
