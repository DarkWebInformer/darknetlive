The reason for the decline in drug use and purchases, according to some users, is ongoing lockdown measures in many regions.<br>According to <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200622232830/https://pandemic-research.github.io/" target="_blank">research</a> by anonymous data-analyst Drugstat and a freelance journalist Andrey Kaganskikh, total drug sales on Hydra decreased by 25% in April 2020. The number of dead drops reduced by 13% during the same month.The Decline of LSD, Cocaine, and Marijuana Sales <br>In March, Hydra users placed 995,580 orders on Hydra. In April, users only placed 747,226 orders. LSD sales declined at record pace – 45% (from 11,586 to 6,364). Marijuana demand fell 40% (from 132,418 to 76,824). Cocaine was bought 34% less often (from 40,354 to 26,600). However, the hash trade remained relatively stable and lost only 7% in volume (from 90,914 to 84,814).<br><img src="../images/drug-sales-change-05108937.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The decentralized production of mephedrone helped keep the mephedrone supply stable</p><br><br>Mephedrone was sold 189,762 times in April and remained the most popular drug in Russia. A-PVP took second place with 91,948 orders. Hash accounted for 84,814 purchases and finished third. LSD, the least favored drug, was purchased only 6,364 times. Heroin surpassed acid by only 226 sales and was ranked second to last.Russians Decreased Overall Drug Consumption <br>DrugStat surveyed 2,361 drug users from Russia and learned:<br><br><li>34% – stopped taking narcotics;</li><li>15% – reduced drug intake;</li><li>8% – increased dosage;</li><li>43% – used as frequently as before the COVID-19 pandemic.</li><br><img src="../images/drug-use-change-min-05222495.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Respondents smoked less marijuana in April.

As a result, the number of stashes with hash buried in Primorsky Krai (Russian Far East) decreased to two a day in April. But on May 1, this number sky-rocketed to 65 as smugglers managed to import a large batch of cannabis concentrate from Afghanistan. In three weeks, the mean price of hash dropped by 16%: from $41 to $34.<br>On April 15, Hydra’s storefronts received a “rent freeze” until the end of the coronavirus-related panic. However, vendors have had to increase drug prices due to shortages and restrictions on traffic. Many carriers refused to deliver drugs in bulk because of the transportation restrictions implemented in many regions.<br>Additional findings are available here: <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200622232830/https://pandemic-research.github.io/" target="_blank">pandemic-research.github.io</a><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
