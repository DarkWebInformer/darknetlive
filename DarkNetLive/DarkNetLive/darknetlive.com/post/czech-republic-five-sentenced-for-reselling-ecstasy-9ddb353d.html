Two defendants received custodial sentences and the other three received suspended sentences. The first two defendants admitted being in charge of the operation. The other three played minor roles in the group’s activities.<br><img src="../images/social-logo-18008933.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A police takedown during the Czech Airlines case.</p><br><br>Police learned of the group after arresting an undisclosed darkweb drug vendor in the Czech Republic. During a raid at the vendor’s house, the police seized a ledger that included customer information.<br>The sales records revealed that the main defendant had purchased approximately 20,000 ecstasy tablets from the vendor. The records showed the defendant had purchased between 50 and 500 ecstasy pills at one time. He had them shipped to his home via the Czech Post.<br>The police executed a search warrant at the main defendant’s residence. The search led to the discovery of a cannabis grow room and evidence of cannabis distribution. While being questioned, the defendant told the police that he had stopped purchasing, using, and reselling drugs.<br><img src="../images/weed-96395084.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A police takedown during the Czech Airlines case.</p><br><br>He disclosed that after purchasing the drugs on the darkweb, he distributed them to his accomplices who resold them in the streets and nightclubs.

He was also ordered to forfeit two vehicles and other assets that he had purchased with the proceeds of the drug trafficking operation.<br><img src="../images/joggin-19270742.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A police takedown during the Czech Airlines case.</p><br><br>The second defendant was sentenced to four years in prison.

Right around the time police busted the group behind Czech Airlines, they also busted a vendor who I believe remains unidentified. The group mentioned in this article was busted immediately after those two busts.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
