From the methamphetamine sales alone, the defendant earned $146,160 in bitcoin. Horakova also sold more than 200 grams of cocaine in 154 transactions. She earned $60,580 in bitcoin from the cocaine sales.<br>Authorities originally charged Horakova in 2015, “but there were significant delays in bringing the case to trial.” By the time the jury reached a verdict in the case, there were 70 pre-trial hearings, four changes of defense attorneys, and multiple abandoned trials.<br>After 70 pre-trial hearings, four changes of defense lawyers, and multiple abandoned trial dates, it was the oldest case on the court’s books by the time a jury reached guilty verdicts in early 2022.<br>“Horakova was convicted of three charges of trafficking a drug of dependence and one of importing a marketable quantity of drugs after she was separately tied to a shoebox full of methamphetamine imported from the US in February 2014.”<br><br>“She also pleaded guilty to possession of methamphetamine, dealing in suspected proceeds of crime and bail breaches.”<br><br>During the trial, Horakova testified that she was not involved in the drug trade. She said she sold high-end handbags online in exchange for Bitcoin. She told the court that her former boyfriend and one of his friends controlled the drug business. Judge Lacava called the story “simply unbelievable” and said that the jury made the correct decision in convicting the woman. “Having heard your evidence and the way you attempted to brazen your way out of trouble, I have concluded you have shown no remorse for your offending,” he said.<br>Horakova will be eligible for parole in four years.<hr><br>Drug trafficker jailed years after crimes | <a class="link" href="https://nz.news.yahoo.com/drug-trafficker-jailed-years-crimes-021231853.html" target="_blank">nz.news.yahoo.com</a>, <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/nwv6K" target="_blank">archive.is</a>, <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220920164023/https://nz.news.yahoo.com/drug-trafficker-jailed-years-crimes-021231853.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHG6PWsXffu4uWrlHSRF6gYCA6ei8YxWIMIGaUC0T1ntY_Apo5775DX8CQuc1kwUZvJl-fDNsK19izt-cvnz6bxbGZTC7Olky_R-EfH0-QGpa10UtGLLZUfRAEhZUjn2MyXYdURAimCY-8SOac_qymNdHscWs_SfFdGEjo8zZpGW" target="_blank">archive.org</a><hr><br><img src="../images/IRS-clearnet-25074330.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The life has been sucked out of the internet.
