During the investigation into the forum, cooperating witnesses conducted undercover purchases from vendors on the site and relied on the middleman services provided by Omnipotent. For instance:<br>“On or about March 5, 2019, in the Eastern District of Virginia and elsewhere, Coelho, who was using the monikers “Downloading,” “Omnipotent,” and “Shiza,” arranged to both sell and serve as the middleman in the transaction to sell approximately 1.1 million stolen access devices to the undercover law enforcement officer. Coelho received a Bitcoin amount that was then equivalent to approximately $4,000; however, he did not provide the stolen access devices.”<br><br>Police in the United Kingdom arrested Coelho on January 31, 2022. In August 2022, a judge ruled that Coelho had substantial ties to the community in the UK and that he would not need to remain in custody for the duration of the extradition proceedings. Since then, Coelho has been “free.”<br>On September 14, 2022, pompompurin, the administrator of the RaidForums replacement BreachForums, <a class="link" href="https://breached.to/Thread-IMPORTANT-Do-not-speak-to-Omnipotent-if-he-reaches-out" target="_blank">posted the following</a>:<br>“Recently, I’ve heard of multiple people (Me included) being contacted by Omni.<br><br>He’s using his real PGP Key, his real old Email address (He emailed me on <a class="link" href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#87f2e9f5eef1e6ebebe2e3c7f7eaa9eae2" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="55203b273c2334393930311525387b3830">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>) and is contacting people at random.

It’s not clear if he is reaching out in order to try to get a lighter sentence by getting information on people.
