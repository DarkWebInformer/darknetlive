This case is clearly worthy of an article.Carolyn Hernandez-Taylor Complaint<br>3. In 2018, HSI Detroit’s Dark Web Task Force (DDWTF), consisting of investigators from HSI, USSS, IRS, CBP, USPIS and MSP identified Victor HERNANDEZ, et al., of Detroit, Michigan as operating as large-scale dark web drug vendor “opiateconnect”.<br><img src="../images/ocshop-31800536.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A screenshot of one of Opiateconnect's vendor shops. | onion.live</p><br><br>4. The investigation has shown that opiateconnect has been a dark web drug vendor since at least 2016 and has operated on most major dark web marketplaces. Currently, in addition to selling high volumes of drugs, including pure/uncut cocaine and pressed Xanax on various dark web marketplaces, opiateconnect also sells to customers on his own onion site and via Jabber direct messaging.<br>5. The DDWTF has identified several members of this organization, including Carolyn HERNANDEZ-TAYLOR, as well as many locations used to receive drugs/supplies, process/manufacture drugs.<br>6. Investigative findings have identified TAYLOR as one of the most active members of the opiateconnect organization. TAYLOR has been routinely observed spending considerable amounts of time, multiple days per week, at the suspected drug processing/packaging location used by opiateconnect.<br>7. DDWTF surveillance has shown when TAYLOR leaves the drug packaging/processing location, she often exits with one or more garbage bags full of drug parcels for mailing to dark web customers around the United States. The DDWTF has observed these parcels being mailed and have seized several packages, all of which contained drugs sold by opiateconnect, including cocaine and pressed Xanax.<br>8. The DDWTF has identified Elizabeth Lynn-Maire ALVAREZ-GARCIA as an associate of TAYLOR. ALVAREZ-GARCIA receives drug parcels from TAYLOR and mails them from the post office in Lincoln Park, Michigan.Surveillance and Mailing of Suspected Drug Parcels <br>9. On December 2, 2021, the DDWTF established surveillance at ALVAREZGARCIA’s residence in Lincoln Park and observed ALVAREZ-GARCIA’S Jeep Patriot (MI EJP3671) parked in front of her apartment building.<br>10. The DDWTF observed a blue 2017 Ford Fusion bearing Michigan license plate number EKT2089, registered to Carolyn TAYLOR 4381 Parkinson Street in Detroit, pull into the apartment complex parking lot and parked behind ALVAREZ GARCIA’s black Jeep. The female driver remained in the car and appeared to be waiting.<br>11. ALVAREZ-GARCIA exited her apartment building and approached the blue Fusion and spoke with the driver through the vehicle window. After a few seconds, ALVAREZ-GARCIA opened the back hatch of her Jeep as well as the trunk of the Fusion. ALVAREZ-GARCIA retrieved a black (semi-full) garbage bag from the Fusion trunk and placed it in the back of her Jeep. ALVAREZ-GARCIA closed the Jeep’s hatch and the Fusion’s trunk. ALVAREZ-GARCIA spoke with the Fusion driver for another moment before entering the driver’s seat of her Jeep. The Fusion exited the parking lot and drove to a neighborhood in southwest Detroit where surveillance was terminated.<br><img src="../images/oc-31066795.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The Opiateconnect subdread logo</p><br><br>12. Shortly after the Fusion departed, ALVAREZ-GARCIA exited the apartment parking lot and drove to the Lincoln Park post office. ALVAREZ-GARCIA exited her Jeep and retrieved the black garbage bag from the back of the vehicle. ALVAREZ-GARCIA entered the post office with the bag and mailed thirteen (13) parcels.<br>13.

ALVAREZ-GARCIA exited the apartment building approached the Fusion, opened the trunk and removed two full black trash bags from the trunk.<br>16. ALVAREZ-GARCIA placed the trash bag into the back-hatch area of her Jeep. ALVAREZ-GARCIA closed the back hatch of her Jeep and the trunk of the Fusion. The Fusion and the Jeep departed the parking lot. ALVAREZ-GARCIA, driving the Jeep, drove to the Lincoln Park post office.<br>17. The DDWTF observed ALVAREZ-GARCIA enter the Lincoln Park post office carrying two black trash bags. ALVAREZ-GARCIA mailed approximately two dozen parcels of various sizes.<br>18. Shortly after ALVAREZ-GARCIA departed the post office, SA Rose (United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General) entered the Lincoln Park post office and examined the parcels mailed by ALVAREZ-GARCIA. SA Rose selected a parcel for further inspection. After obtaining a federal search warrant, the parcel was opened and found to contain 1221 pressed blue B707 bars, counterfeit alprazolam bars. The bars were sent to the Michigan State Police Metro Detroit Forensic Laboratory and found to contain Clonazolam, which is not a scheduled controlled substance and is not FDA approved for medical use in the United States.<br>(Note: Clonazolam is a dangerous and understudied benzodiazepine, classification of drugs. Clonazolam (known on the street as Clon, Clam, or C-lam) is more than twice as strong as Xanax (alprazolam) and is the preferred active ingredient of pressed Xanax sold on the dark web). Clonazolam is not FDA approved, and thus illegal to consume and import into the United StatesSurveillance and Seizure of Drug Parcel <br>19. On January 18, 2022, the DDWTF initiated surveillance at 4381 Parkinson Street, Detroit, Michigan on the blue Ford Fusion, registered to Carolyn TAYLOR at 4381 Parkinson Street.<br>20.

After obtaining a federal search warrant, a search of the package found it to contain green pills identical to the those sold by opiateconnect. Lab analysis conducted by the Michigan State Police Metro Detroit Lab showed the pills contained Clonazolam.Summary of Electronic and Video Surveillance of TAYLOR <br>60. Continuous electronic surveillance, over the course of several weeks, of TAYLOR’s Ford Fusion, coupled with video surveillance at opiateconnect drug processing/packaging location on Florida Street in Detroit, video surveillance behind 919 Livernois in Detroit and video surveillance at the Lincoln Park post office, shows a consistent and frequent pattern:<br>61. TAYLOR leaves her residence, located at 4381 Parkinson Street in Detroit, on weekday mornings and drives to 5852 Florida Street in Detroit. TAYLOR parks near the back door of 5852 Florida Street and enters the residence via the front door. After a period of time, often a few hours, TAYLOR exits the back door of the residence with full black trash bags and places them in her Ford Fusion.<br>62. TAYLOR leaves 5852 Florida Street and drives to either 919 Livernois Avenue in Detroit (ALVAREZ-GARCIA’s parent’s residence) or to ALVAREZGARCIA’s apartment complex in Lincoln Park. After a few moments at these locations, ALVAREZ-GARCIA arrives at the U.S. Post Office in Lincoln Park with full garbage bags and mails dozens of suspected drug parcels.<br>63. This pattern had been corroborated with physical surveillance by the DDWTF.Conclusion <br>Based on the foregoing, I have probable cause to believe, and I do believe, TAYLOR has committed, is committing, and will continue to commit violations of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, unlawful possession with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance).<hr><br>She appears to have been released on a $10,000 unsecured bond.<br>Victor Hernandez Complaint <br>Investigation Background <br>4. Investigators have identified Victor HERNANDEZ as a dark web market supplier of scheduled and counterfeit controlled substances. HERNANDEZ uses the moniker of opiateconnect or opiateconnect369 to anonymously sell the drugs on the dark web. From at least January, 2022, investigators have seized multiple drug parcels which surveillance confirms originated from 5852 Florida Street, in Detroit, Michigan. These parcels have contained various controlled substances, including Cocaine.Search Warrant and Seizure of Narcotics <br>5. On Tuesday August 23, 2022, the DDWTF executed a federal search warrant at the residence of Victor HERNANDEZ located at 5852 Florida Street in Detroit, Michigan. During the search, agents found a clandestine pill manufacturing operation, to include a large pill press, mixer, mixing/binding agents and active ingredients for making counterfeit alprazolam bars (clonazolam, etizolam) and bulk pressed counterfeit alprazolam bars.<br>6. Additionally, agents discovered a large quantity of a white powdery substance, that field tested positive for cocaine and a powdery substance that field tested positive for MDMA.<br>7. In additional to the lab and drugs, agents seized bulk U.S. currency and multiple firearms.<br>8. Moreover, investigators recovered packaging materials, to include a label maker, as well as evidence of multiple of parcel mailings.<br>9. At the time of the warrants, Victor HERNANDEZ was present at the residence. HERNANDEZ acknowledged that he rents the residence and is the sole occupant.<br>10. A criminal history check revealed that HERNANDEZ is a convicted felon and is prohibited from possessing any firearms.Conclusion <br>Based on the foregoing, I have probable cause to believe HERNANDEZ has committed violations of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846 (conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances, unlawful possession with intent to manufacture, distribute, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance), as well as 18 U.S.C. §§ 922 and 924(c).<hr><br><img src="../images/vh-21931286.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">V.H. was arrested in 2018 for drug and firearm-related crimes.</p><br><br>Victor Hernandez was busted in 2018.
