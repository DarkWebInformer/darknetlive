Monaco said at the International Conference on Cyber Security. “Not only did this allow us to recover their ransom payment as well as a ransom paid by previously unknown victims, but we were also able to identify a previously unidentified ransomware strain. The approach used in this case exemplifies how the Department of Justice is attacking malicious cyber activity from all angles to disrupt bad actors and prevent the next victim.”<br><img src="../images/IMG-N0S3-46675475.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco at the International Conference on Cyber Security</p><br><br>According to an announcement from the Department of Justice (DOJ), North Korean hackers used a ransomware strain called Maui to encrypt the files and servers of a hospital in Kansas in May 2021. After a week without access to their infrastructure and data, the hospital paid the hackers approximately $100,000 in Bitcoin to decrypt their files. After being infected by the ransomware, the hospital cooperated with law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Burea of Investigation (FBI). Because of their cooperation, the FBI identified “<a class="link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-warns-of-maui-ransomware-attacks-against-healthcare-orgs/" target="_blank">never-before-seen North Korean ransomware</a>” and traced the Bitcoin payment to a money-launderer in China.<br><img src="../images/encrypting-files-64421359.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Maui ransomware encrypting files | BleepingComputer</p><br><br>In April 2022, the FBI learned that the hackers had received another payment of approximately $120,000 worth of Bitcoin. An investigation into the payment revealed that a medical provider in Colorado had paid a ransom to the same hacking group.<br>In May 2022, the FBI seized two cryptocurrency accounts the hackers had used to receive ransom payments. After the seizure, the District of Kansas moved to forfeit the Bitcoin and return it to the healthcare providers.<hr><br>“cryptocurrency accounts” = custodial wallets<br>Justice Department Seizes and Forfeits Approximately $500,000 from North Korean Ransomware Actors and their Conspirators | <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220720144907/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-and-forfeits-approximately-500000-north-korean-ransomware-actors" target="_blank">archive.org</a>, <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/A39Rz" target="_blank">archive.is</a>, <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-and-forfeits-approximately-500000-north-korean-ransomware-actors" target="_blank">justice.gov</a><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
