The measures have resulted in success by most standards. Although drug crimes and drug abuse have generally decreased, the Chinese government has noted an increase in drug money laundering via cryptocurrencies. In addition, people are increasingly turning to the internet to buy and sell drugs.id="general-figures"&gt;General Figures [list]<li>By the end of 2021, there were 1.486 million drug users in China, down 17.5% from 2020;[*]After three years of abstinence, 3.403 million people had relapsed, up 13.4% since 2020;[*]121,000 people used drugs for the first time, down 21.7% year on year;[*]The number of existing drug abusers and newly discovered drug abusers decreased for five consecutive years;[*]Among existing drug users, 556,000 abused heroin, 793,000 methamphetamine, 37,000 ketamine and 18,000 marijuana, down 19%, 18.5%, 9% and 10.7% respectively;[*]Foreign suppliers account for the majority of drugs seized;[*]Police seized 17.3 tons of methamphetamine, ketamine, and other “mainstream drugs,” of which 15.3 tons came from overseas and two tons from domestic manufacturers, down 21.7% and 48.2%, respectively;[*]Police seized 690 kilograms of cocaine from South America in 2021.

Targeting internet-based drug trafficking is one of the sector’s top priorities.<hr><br>[em]China Drug Crime Report 2021[/em] | <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220623100855/http://www.nncc626.com/2022-06/23/c_1211659746.htm" target="_blank">archive.org</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.nncc626.com/2022-06/23/c_1211659746.htm" target="_blank">nncc626.com</a><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
