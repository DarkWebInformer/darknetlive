The investigators reportedly recovered an electronic document with records of sales made by the duo. The document showed that between May and November 2022, the duo dealt with approximately 1,500 buyers and processed 3,800 orders. They consequently distributed approximately 123,188 fentanyl-laced pills and 143 kilograms of methamphetamine.
