In addition to descriptions of the explosive devices, investigators provided the information about the specific packages mailed by the bomber.<br>Between late December and early January, seven businesses <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/UHJGh" target="_blank">received mail bombs</a> as part of an extortion plot by an unidentified suspect or number of suspects. The first seven bombs failed to detonate. In early February, four more businesses received explosive mail. Three of the bombs exploded.
