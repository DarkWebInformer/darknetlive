The investigators almost always track the bitcoin to the vendor's account at a crypto exchange. I some cases, the vendors are so sloppy, that their identities are uncovered without the undercover purchases.<br>Let's take a look at a vendors whose operations were characterized by bad OPSEC.<br><h2>Canna_Bars</h2><br>Jose Robert Porras III was identified as the operator of the Canna_Bars vendor account on Dream Market in investigations that were part of Operation Dark Gold. Vendors busted in the operation sent bitcoin to investigators in exchange for cash mailed to their residences.<br>In addition to sending Bitcoin to  LE, Porras made the mistake of sharing photos that had his fingerprints visible.<br>According to the <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.337646/gov.uscourts.caed.337646.7.0.pdf" target="_blank">criminal complaint</a>, while reviewing the Canna_Bars vendor account on Dream Market, the investigators found out that the account had a verified review from Hansa Market.<br>The investigators contacted the Dutch National Police who had taken control of Hansa market for over a month in 2017. The Dutch Police provided data for the Canna_Bars vendor account on Hansa.<br>While reviewing the data the investigators discovered that Canna_Bars had provided a customer with a link to an <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190618152133/https://imgur.com/a/uy7PY" target="_blank">Imgur album</a>. The album included a high-resolution picture of the vendor's hand holding cannabis buds.<br><img src="../images/Canna-Bars-photos-05b72a78.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">One of the photos in the album</p><br>In March 2018, the investigators downloaded the image and had the fingerprints analyzed. The fingerprints in the image were a match to Porras's fingerprints acquired from prior arrests.<br>Porras and his accomplice were consequently arrested and charged in a 16-count indictment.<br>Porras pleaded guilty to one count each of distribution of a controlled substance and firearm possession as a felon. He was <a class="link" href="dream-vendor-canna-bars-sentenced-to-prison/index.html" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to five years and 10 months in prison in December 2019.<br><h2>Blime-Sub and BTH-Overdose</h2><br>Emil Vladimirov Babadjov was identified as the operator of the Blime-Sub and BTH-Overdose, vendor accounts after a brief investigation, thanks to his sloppy OPSEC.<br>The DEA <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.307681.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">launched investigations</a> into “Blime-Sub” and BTH-Overdose on AplhaBay in September 2016. A review of the PGP key associated with the vendor account revealed that the key was registered to the email address: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bbd9dad9dadfd1d4cdfbdcd6dad2d795d8d4d6">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br>A Facebook search revealed that the email address was associated with an account registered to "Lime Vojdabab," Emil Babadjov in reverse.<br>In November, the DEA asked Coinbase to provide information on any account registered to the email. Coinbase revealed that in November 2015, the email was used to open an account registered to Emil Babadjov. Coinbase also revealed that Babadjov had attempted to open an account in March 2016 using the email <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="26444a4f4b4355534466414b474f4a0845494b">[email&#160;protected]</a>. This piece of information connected <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="afcdc3c6c2cadcdacdefc8c2cec6c381ccc0c2">[email&#160;protected]</a> to the Blime-Sub vendor account.<br>In October, the investigators made an undercover purchase of heroin from Blime-Sub on AlphaBay. The white powder the investigators received tested positive for both heroin and fentanyl. The investigators found fingerprints on the package used to mail the drugs. Fingerprint analysis revealed that the fingerprints found were a match for Babadjov.<br>Further investigations revealed that the postage on the drug package had been purchased from a Self Service Kiosk at a post office in San Francisco. Photos taken during the purchase confirmed that Babadjov purchased the postage and mailed the drug package.<br>Babadjov was consequently charged with distributing fentanyl and heroin and arrested in December 2016. He pleaded guilty in October 2017. <br>Babadjov was <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/dark-web-drug-traffickers-sentenced-separate-cases-80-months-and-70-months-prison" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to 5 years and 10 months in prison in January 2018.<br><h2>OxyMonster</h2><br>Gal Vallerius, a French national, started as an Oxycodone and Ritalin vendor on Evolution Dream and TradeRoute as  OxyMonster. He later became a senior moderator and admin at Dream Market.<br>All the investigators had to do to link Vallerius to OxyMonster was <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.512818.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">track bitcoin</a> transactions. Blockchain analysis of a bitcoin address used by OxyMonster to receive tips revealed that the address sent bitcoin to a Localbitcoins account registered to Vallerius.<br><img src="../images/oxymonster-address-b3958093.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The bitcoin address</p><br>On August 31, 2017, Vallerius traveled to the US to attend a beard competition in Texas. The investigators searched his laptop at Atlanta International Airport. The investigators found login credentials to Dream Market, and a PGP encryption key entitled "OxyMonster". The key matched OxyMonster's PGP key on Dream Market. The investigators also found bitcoin worth $500,000 at the time.<br>Vallerius <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/dark-web-vendor-pleads-guilty-narcotics-trafficking-and-money-laundering-charges" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances and conspiracy to launder money.

A social media search of the terms "Adashc31" and "Adashc" led them to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts used by Farooq.<br><img src="../images/farooq-twitter-7db1d526.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Farooq' s Twitter account</p><br>In April the investigators subpoenaed Facebook for information on the account registered to Farooq. The information acquired from Facebook gave the DEA access to a phone number associated with Farooq's account. The DEA later established that the phone number was part of an investigation into heroin trafficking in Brooklyn.<br>In May the agent purchased heroin from Area51 and DarkApollo. In each of the drug packages the agent received, the heroin was placed in a clear zip bag placed inside a silver Mylar envelope.

Farooq was <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/second-man-sentenced-prison-distributing-heroin-dark-web-marketplace-alphabay" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to a year and 11 months in prison in January 2018.<br><h2>Chlnsaint</h2><br>Chlnsaint was a fentanyl, heroin, and oxycodone vendor on Empire Market. Chaloner Saintillus put little effort into the security of his drug trafficking operation. To begin with, he used the abbreviation of his real name as his vendor name. <br>The investigators made the first undercover purchase in April 2020. USPS records revealed that the package's postage was purchased at a Self Service Kiosk. Images taken during <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.caed.381661/gov.uscourts.caed.381661.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">the purchase</a> showed Saintillus made the purchase. The card used to pay for that and other purchases belonged to Saintillus.<br>A further review of USPS records revealed that there existed three USPS accounts associated with Saintillus. Two of the accounts had been created with an email address: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2142494d4f5240484f5561464c40484d0f424e4c">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br><img src="../images/chlnsaint-USPS-f14c3615.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The USPS accounts</p><br>An open internet search of Saintillus led the investigators to a dating site profile with the username “Chlnsaint”. The profile had Saintillus' photo.<br>The Investigators arrested him on October 2020 and seized large quantities of drugs, approximately $25,000 in XRP, and a loaded firearm after searching his residence.<br>In April 2023, Saintillus <a class="link" href="empire-market-vendor-chlnsaint-pleads-guilty-d8eb422b.html" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to distributing controlled substances. He will be sentenced in July.<br>Foolproof security measures may not exist but studying mistakes made by other vendors and avoiding similar mistakes could go a long way in making sure vendors are not caught.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div><script data-cfasync="false" src="../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script></body>
