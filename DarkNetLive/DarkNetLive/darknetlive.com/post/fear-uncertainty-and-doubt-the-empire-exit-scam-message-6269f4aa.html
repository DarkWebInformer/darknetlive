The screenshot—purportedly between a vendor and the administrator of Empire Market—is likely the work of someone actively spreading misinformation about the marketplace.<br>Edit: Empire Market staff member Se7en found this post too vague regarding the faked screenshots. Here is a clarity update: the screenshots are fake. The good news for everyone emailing me about the lack of any support presence on the market is that support clearly exists.<hr><br><span class="font-bold">The Screenshot </span><br><br>An entity using the name ScammerLee <a class="link" href="http://dreadditevelidot.onion/post/fa5d63a7f6d172bd90e9/#c-0bdc80dc2d3e08fc63" target="_blank">posted a screenshot</a> on the Empire Market subdread on June 13, 2019, that depicted a conversation between the darkweb vendor La_Farmacia and Syndey, an admin of Empire Market. In their conversation, the administrator had sent a response to La_Farmacia’s request for FE privileges (the ability to receive funds up front instead up waiting for a package delivery).<br>The purported messages between the market admin and vendor have a timestamp indicating the conversation took place on June 12.<br><span class="font-bold">Syndey</span>: <span class="italic">Last day before our discontinuation of the website is 07/07. We will grant FE but your commission rate goes up to 25% for the priviledge.

But to people using Empire Market or with funds on the market, the “discontinuation of the website is 07/07” is a cause for concern.<br>The OP of the post, ScammerLee, <a class="link" href="http://dreadditevelidot.onion/post/fa5d63a7f6d172bd90e9/#c-081967b901fb36d345" target="_blank">claimed</a> he had hacked the vendor’s account and had access to the vendor’s messages.<br>the dumbass uses WIN 10 with a outdated bios firmware. Was fairly simple deploying my rat. wasn’t even a hack into his account..he just leaves his computer on and paged logged in all the time.<br><br>Assuming ScammerLee had actually hacked the vendor’s account, he would have effectively needed an unrealistic level of skill to remotely inject a remote control system into the bios of an unknown manufacturer’s computer.

Verify my PGP key on the profile and you will see that it’s the same key we have always used.<br>Peace and Love,<br>-team La_Farmacia<br><br>Recent feedback on both La_Farmacia and La_Farmacia1 indicate that the vendor has exit scammed. So does the feedback on the vendor’s account for selling marijuana: SpriteLee. The other accounts allegedly owned by the vendor also have feedback indicating that the vendor is no longer shipping packs and is requiring users to finalize early. If customers question the finalize early request, the vendor allegedly tells them that he will not be sending their product.<br><img src="../images/la-farmacia-neg-feedback-59221363.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">La_Farmacia Negative Feedback</p><br><br>It now seems the vendor has access to his main vendor account on Empire Market. The PGP key is no longer different than the original La_Farmacia key (A7BCB12B1A39463AD0EC7E220A31CBB0E543B733)<br>Perhaps the most damning piece of evidence is that La_Farmacia’s account on Empire market is <span class="font-bold"><span class="italic">still set to Escrow-only</span></span> and the vendor is still messaging users and requesting that they mark the package as delivered (this is a forbidden practice on most markets and is considered an unofficial version of market-endorsed FE privileges.<br><img src="../images/la-farmacia-no-escrow-74747612.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">La_Farmacia No FE</p><br><hr><br><span class="font-bold">The Message </span><br><br>La_Farmacia is sending customers a message with the following content:<br>Dear Customers,<br>We have some fairly good news for you. Our shop has recently received back the temporary access to our seller account at Empire via private mirror link, which we would love to share with you as our valuable client.<br>[redacted] (save it &amp; don’t share it please)<br>We will also be granting all of our customers the 108 extra on any following purchases as an expression of an apology.<br>We truly feel your frustration and are actively keeping track of the issue while working closely with the Empire team to keep our customers updated until this matter is resolved.<br>We would like to thank you for your patience and apologize for the inconvenience caused,<br>La Farmacia<br><br><img src="../images/la-farmacia-fake-mirror-14571563.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The Police Sent This Not La Farmacia</p><br><br>The link included in the message is a link to what appears to be an Empire Market mirror. Logins work. Registrations work. You can login with an Empire Market account. You can create an account on his “private” mirror and then login to Empire Market with the same login. Two things stand out, though.<br><br><li>The mirror provided by La_Farmacia is not verifiable like all other Empire Market mirrors. When attempting to verify the mirror through the /verify link on the “private” Empire Market landing page, the user will be directed to an endless loop of failed captchas. On the real Empire Market, completion of the captcha leads to a page with signed proof that the current link is a valid Empire Market address.</li><li>The headers returned from the “private” Empire Market do not match those returned by the real Empire Market to a significant degree. This itself is cause for concern. One of the few reasons La_Farmacia would be sending out a fake link to Empire Market is to harvest credentials. Which seems odd, especially when he wants users to use the link to purchase from him on the market. If the customers were trying to place an order with the vendor, why would the vendor send the customers somewhere else to place an order? The money would end up in the vendors account either way.</li><img src="../images/fake-empire-headers-94690301.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500"> </p><hr><br><span class="font-bold">Conclusion </span><br><br>I am very sorry to have left readers with no real conclusion whatsoever as to whether or not the screenshot is fake. I know some hard evidence would make things easier. But from the information above, hopefully one can draw their own conclusions as to the validity of the screenshot based on the legitimacy of the source.<br><br><li>We know that the vendor’s account was not hacked.</li><li>We know he stopped mailing packages.</li><li>We know he sent users an message with a link to <span class="italic">not-Empire-Market</span>.</li><li>And we know the vendor still lacks FE privileges.</li><br>I personally believe the screenshot is fake and is not proof that Empire Market will exit scam on July 7, 2019. Will they exit scam in the future? Who knows. Most markets either get seized or exit scam. But this screenshot is not evidence of an impending exit scam. Customers are finally reporting that their tickets are being fulfilled.<br>Also, from a logical perspective, why would the market administrator both provide a vendor with the ability to quickly remove his funds from wallets controlled by the market and tell the vendor that he planned to vanish with the funds from vendors and customers? This would reduce the funds available to the market in the event of an exit scam. FE privileges are great for vendors looking to exit scam. They are not beneficial to a market looking to make the same move.<hr><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
