Shipp sentenced 30-year-old Andrew Tablack, of Beverly Hills, California, to 30 years in prison. A <a class="link" href="xanaxking2-convicted-by-a-jury-in-california/index.html" target="_blank">jury convicted</a> Tablack of one count of manufacturing, supplying, and possessing with intent to manufacture and distribute cyclopropyl fentanyl pills and one count of conspiracy to Manufacture and Distribute Fentanyl pills.<br><img src="../images/presses-32609241.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">This picture, which is is frequently used in other fent-related articles, originally came from a DEA bust in this case IIRC.</p><br><br>An investigation led by <a class="link" href="../taskforces/ocdetf/index.html" target="_blank">the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF)</a> resulted in Tablack’s arrest and subsequent imprisonment. The task force’s investigation revealed that Tablack and his accomplice Stephan Durham, 43, masterminded a fentanyl pill production operation from California. According to court records, the duo produced and distributed fentanyl-laced pills from at least March 2017 through December 2017.<br>The duo produced and distributed hundreds of thousands of fentanyl analogue pills throughout the United States using a vendor account on <a class="link" href="../markets/index.html" target="_blank">a darkweb marketplace</a>. Investigators identified Tablack as the vendor “<a class="link" href="../arrested-darknet-vendors/index.html#xanaxking2" target="_blank">XanaxKing2</a>.”<br>A 2017 investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) resulted in the seizure of approximately 300,000 pills containing cyclopropyl fentanyl at a residence in Monmouth County, New Jersey. During the investigation, the DEA found packages of cyclopropyl fentanyl pills at other homes in Monmouth County. Investigators later identified Tablack as the source of the drugs.<br><img src="../images/firmapress-80610435.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Pill presses put you on a list.</p><br><br>Taskforce members examined shipping records and found that a company in California had purchased nine pill presses. The supplier of the presses had shipped them to an industrial property leased to the same company. Further investigation revealed that Durham, Tablack’s co-defendant, owned the company.<br>Investigators intercepted packages addressed to the property leased by Durham’s company. The packages, which originated in China, contained fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and other material used in the pill production process. Court documents revealed that the fentanyl supplier had disguised the drugs as food items or beauty products.<br>Police arrested both defendants in December 2017.
