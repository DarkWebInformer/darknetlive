Unhosted wallets often engage in transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges, which are subject to AML/CFT regulation […] Law enforcement can engage with cryptocurrency exchanges with respect to suspicious activity reporting and other reports that might be applicable to them in terms of getting some degree of understanding in terms of transactions with unhosted wallets as well.”<br><img src="../images/woman-60956294.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">🪝🪝🪝</p><br><br>Representatives also asked questions about FinCEN’s ability to counter the potential use of cryptocurrency by “Russian oligarchs” to evade sanctions imposed by the United States. Das reiterated <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/chAfE" target="_blank">FinCEN’s position from March</a> when he answered a similar question:<br>“In the face of mounting economic pressure on Russia, it is vitally important for U.S. financial institutions to be vigilant about potential Russian sanctions evasion, including by both state actors and oligarchs. Although we have not seen widespread evasion of our sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency, prompt reporting of suspicious activity contributes to our national security and our efforts to support Ukraine and its people.”<br><img src="../images/peter-91597390.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">🪝🪝🪝</p><br><br>At the recent hearing, Das said, “we’ve not seen large-scale evasion through the use of cryptocurrency, but we’re mindful of that and we’re working with financial institutions so that they’re aware of that potential that we can identify a large-scale evasion using cryptocurrency and act on it as well.”<br>“Oversight of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network”<br><li>Memorandum <a class="link" href="fincen-patriot-act-powers-are-not-the-right-size-for-crypto-threats/documents/memorandum.html" target="_blank">pdf</a></li><li>Summary page <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/GV558" target="_blank">archive.is</a>, <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220429145716/https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=409259" target="_blank">archive.org</a>, <a class="link" href="https://financialservices.house.gov/events/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=409259" target="_blank">financialservices.house.gov</a></li><li>YouTube broadcast <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvrVpvEzJeA" target="_blank">youtube.com</a> </li></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
