The site administrators out of Thailand and Australia had been arrested in January.<br><br>“The Thai administrator admitted to sexually abusing 11 young boys in a small village in Thailand and to selling the material on Boyxzeed.net,” the criminal complaint said. “Law enforcement obtained some of the images and videos of the Thai boys produced by the Thai offender.”<br><br>Investigators learned the site had Open, Premium and Secret levels of membership. Interpol gave HSI investigators information on U.S. members. One of those user names, a “Secret” level member from Nov. 15, 2017, through Dec. 20, 2017, traced to Donshik’s home, a mile and a half from Ben Gamla Prep.<br>Broward County Teacher Pleads Guilty to Possessing Child Pornography <br>A Broward county teacher pled guilty yesterday to possessing child pornography.<br>Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and Mark Selby, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.<br>Gregg Donshik, 47, of Hollywood, Florida, pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2252(a)(4)(B).

Donshik is facing a maximum statutory sentence of 20 years in prison.<br>According to court documents, in March 2018, HSI Miami received information from Interpol regarding internet users in the U.S. who had created accounts and purchased child pornography on the dark web. In relation to this investigation, federal law enforcement executed a search warrant at Donshik’s residence and recovered several computers and other electronic media, containing images and videos of children being sexually abused. At the time of his arrest, Donshik was employed as a teacher [at Ben Gamla Preparatory Academy Charter School in Hollywood]. However, evidence indicated he accessed and possessed the child pornography from his home.<br>This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood (PSC), a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by United States Attorneys’ Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who sexually exploit children, and to identify and rescue victims.
