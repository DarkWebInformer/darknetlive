The company allows its customers to download reports with all of an individual's PII information.<br>To open an account on the platform, Hooker claimed he had been ordered to open an account on the paltform and use it to verify the information of Navy personnel. The company approved the account on September 9, 2018.<br>Hooker and Chalk consequently ran tens of thousands of searches on the company's database. By December 18, when the company suspended Hooker's account, the couple had acquired the PII of over 9,000 individuals.<br>In March 2019, Hooker attempted to open another account on the company's platform. He asked a Navy officer to claim he had been asked by the Navy to use the company's database to conduct background checks on Navy personnel. Hopper and his accomplice attempted to use fraudulent documents to convince the company to approve the account. Their attempts failed as the company flagged the account for fraud.<br>Hooker and Chalk were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple counts of wire fraud and identity theft in a 16-count indictment filed in January 2021.
