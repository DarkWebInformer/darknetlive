The quintet distributed the drugs through the "Drugpharmacist" and "RickandMortyShop" vendor profiles on the now-defunct marketplaces, Dream and Wall Street.<br>The investigators launched investigations into the operations of Drugpharmacist in June 2018.

Inside the envelope, was a thank you note and drugs hidden in a stuffed animal.

In the properties, the defendants prepared the drug packages according to orders received from Drugpharmacist and RickandMortyShop.

A search of the apartment resulted in the seizure of 128 grams of methamphetamine in a sealed bag, 25 grams of cocaine in a plastic container, and multiple packages of heroin.
