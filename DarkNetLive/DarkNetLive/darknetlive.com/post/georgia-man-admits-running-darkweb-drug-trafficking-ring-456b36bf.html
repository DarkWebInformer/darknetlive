Four out of his five co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty to similar crimes.<br><a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191211193022/https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdga/pr/lead-defendant-pleads-guilty-drug-conspiracy-produced-distributed-powerful-synthetic" target="_blank">U.S. Attorney Christine</a>:<br>This drug trafficking conspiracy distributed massive amounts of dangerous illegal drugs, including deadly synthetic opioids, throughout the streets of Georgia and through the Dark Web.

The illicit ingredients were purchased on the Dark Web using cryptocurrency, with the counterfeit Xanax likewise sold on the Dark Web or through conventional illegal drug distribution channels.<br><br>The conspirators moved the four pill presses to various locations in the Southern, Northern and Middle Districts of Georgia to avoid detection, and at one point began manufacturing and selling synthetic heroin using Fentanyl and the more-powerful Carfentanil.<br><br>The DEA investigation into Forrester began in September 2017 when they learned he had imported another industrial pill press.
