He would then make Bitcoin deposits into the accounts followed by successive withdrawals whose total exceeded his initial deposits.<br>In one such case on September 19, 2012, ZHONG allegedly deposited 500 Bitcoin into a Silk Road account he had created. He then made five withdrawals of 500 Bitcoin each from the account within one second. In total, Zhong made approximately 140 similar transactions and was able to withdraw a total of approximately 50,000 bitcoin.<br>In 2017 he received a total of 50,000 Bitcoin Cash into the wallets as a result of the Bitcoin hard fork. He later swapped the Bitcoin Cash into approximately 3,500 Bitcoin.<br>Close to a decade later, investigators executed a search warrant at Zhong's residence on November 9, 2021. The investigators found and seized approximately 50,500 Bitcoin worth over $3 billion at the time. They also recovered and seized $661,900 in cash, 25 Casascius coins, silver bars, gold bars, and one gold coin.<br><img src="../images/safe-e57aad83.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The seizied items</p><br>He later surrendered a total of approximately 1,004 bitcoin in March, April, May, and June 2022.<br><img src="../images/popcontinerandcomputer-e70f880b.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The popcorn container and single board computer</p><br>Zhong <a class="link" href="feds-seize-3-36-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-connected-to-silk-road-821a6315.html" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to one count of wire fraud on November 4, 2022.<br>In total, Zhong was ordered to forfeit approximately 51,680.32 bitcoin worth over $1.5 billion.
