Randal Hall sentenced Walker Christian Forrester to 240 months in prison for a charge of Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Carfentanil, Alprazolam, and marijuana).<br>“The criminals in this drug trafficking conspiracy distributed massive amounts of dangerous illegal drugs, including deadly synthetic opioids, on the streets of Georgia and beyond through the Dark Web. Our federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies did outstanding work in investigating and shutting down these manufacturers of misery and bringing them to justice.”<br><br>-- U.S. Attorney Christine.<br>Federal investigators identified Forrester as the leader of a Georgia-based drug trafficking conspiracy. Three co-conspirators have already received prison sentences for their roles in the conspiracy and <a class="link" href="four-guilty-pleas-entered-in-darkweb-drug-trafficking-murder-case/index.html" target="_blank">the remaining co-conspirators have entered guilty pleas</a> for similar crimes.<br><br><li><span class="font-bold">Kolbie Watters</span> was sentenced to life in prison plus ten years for Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances, and Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime.</li><li><span class="font-bold">Jonathan Lester</span> was sentenced to 210 months in prison for Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Carfentanil, Alprazolam, and marijuana).</li><li><span class="font-bold">Morgan Slaton</span> was sentenced to three years’ probation for Conspiracy to Distribute and Possession with Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance (Alprazolam).</li><li><span class="font-bold">Armand Saedi</span> pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Possess with Intent to Distribute and to Distribute Controlled Substances (Alprazolam).</li><br>All defendants received an additional five years of supervised release following the completion of their prison sentences.<br>Although the group produced and distributed pills in 2016, they avoided the radar of investigators until September 2017 when Forrester ordered an additional industrial pill press. The purchase caught the attention of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The agency began investigating Forrester and the other co-conspirators by extension.<br><br><br><br>In November 2017, police officers in Harlem, Georgia, conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Forrester. Watters and a juvenile were also in the car. During a search of the vehicle, police officers found more than 5,200 counterfeit Xanax pills, a quantity of marijuana, and a sawed-off shotgun. It is unclear if Forrester legally owned the short-barreled shotgun.<br>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) requires owners of short-barreled shotguns (and short-barreled rifles) to complete a form and pay for a $200 tax stamp prior to owning the short-barreled firearm. Owning a short-barreled rifle or shotgun without the BATFE’s approval is a violation of the National Firearms Act (NFA). Forrester was never charged with a violation of the NFA. However, possession of any firearm while committing a drug trafficking crime is illegal (hence the Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Crime charge).<br>Investigators learned that Forrester and his co-conspirators started manufacturing counterfeit Xanax pills and selling them on the darkweb in 2016. At the peak of their operation, the group produced and distributed more than 200,000 pills every month. The operation yielded profits of almost $20,000 every month during its peak.<br><a class="link" href="georgia-man-admits-running-large-scale-drug-trafficking-operation/index.html" target="_blank">Forrester also admitted receiving packages of fentanyl</a> from China, repackaging the received narcotic, and then shipping the package to a darkweb vendor in Canada. The vendor in Canada paid Forrester $10,000 every month for this service. Although the announcement did not name the vendor in Canada, it did state that a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia had indicted the Canadian drug trafficker.<br>There is a well-known case in the Northern District of Georgia that matches the description provided by the Southern District of Georgia’s announcement: <a class="link" href="the-rcmp-arrested-xanaxlabs/index.html" target="_blank">United States v. Arden McCann</a>, an alleged darkweb vendor from Canada. McCann, according to the indictment, sold alprazolam, fentanyl, and fentanyl analogs on almost every mainstream darkweb marketplace.
