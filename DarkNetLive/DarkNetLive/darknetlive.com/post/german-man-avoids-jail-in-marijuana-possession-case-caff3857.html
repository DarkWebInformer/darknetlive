A judge sentenced the defendant to a suspended sentence of one year and ten months instead of jail time.<br>In 2019, police in Dortmund, Germany, <a class="link" href="../tags/darkweb-vendors/index.html" target="_blank">arrested a darkweb vendor</a>. The vendor had been selling marijuana on an undisclosed marketplace, according to prosecutors. Investigators obtained a list of the vendor’s customers. While examining the records, investigators identified the 26-year-old defendant as a repeat customer.<br>Pursuant to an arrest warrant, the police arrested the man at Augsburg Central Station. After the arrest, the police searched the defendant’s apartment. Police discovered three cannabis plants in a bedroom closet.<br>During one hearing, the defendant told the court that he had first used cannabis in 2013. He explained that he had turned to the darkweb to avoid dependence on local suppliers. The prosecution expressed concern over the defendant’s willingness to buy drugs online. “It is not much different than when you order something through Amazon,” the defendant said. During an interview with police, the defendant admitted ordering between 20 and 100 grams of marijuana.<br>The defendant told the court that he had stopped using drugs after his arrest. The defendant also explained that he would lose his job if sentenced to prison. The prosecution noted the defendant’s lifestyle changes in its sentencing recommendation. Prosecutor Benjamin Junghans congratulated the 26-year-old for the sobriety. During the hearing, Junghans asked the court for a suspended sentence of one year and ten months. Dr. Silke Ackermann, defending, wanted a shorter sentence. Ackermann proposed a suspended sentence of one year and seven months.<br>Judge Alexander Kessler <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200518150358/https://www.kreisbote.de/lokales/landsberg/drogendelikt-bewaehrung-trotz-vorstrafen-13763285.html" target="_blank">sided with the prosecution</a>.
