After analyzing the data by the suspect’s Internet provider, more than 17,000 lines of chat communication were seized and evaluated. In it, the perpetrators also revealed their real names.

The two main defendants from North Rhine-Westphalia are charged with, among other things, 35,569 cases of commercial and gang-related computer fraud and 144,871 cases of the web-based unauthorised exploitation of copyrighted works. The third accusation is said to have helped you in particular by concealing payment flows.<br>“LuL.to” was a large online portal through which books (e-books), audiobooks, as well as newspapers and magazines (e-paper) can be downloaded as MP3 or PDF files against payment of small amounts without the consent of the authors or authorised persons. were offered. The portal was taken off the web by investigators as early as June 2017.<br>The offer on the <a class="link" href="https://www.lul.to/" target="_blank">www.LuL.to</a> website included more than 200,000 titles, including about 170,000 German-language e-books and 28,000 audiobooks alone. Nearly 50,000 customers used the portal’s illegal services from 2013 to 2017, acquiring more than 6 million titles. The total illegal offer of copyrighted works on LuL.to amounted to at least 11 terabytes.<br>The accused, who have not yet come forward with criminal charges, have largely confessed in the investigation. Initially, arrest warrants obtained were therefore suspended in all cases in the meantime against conditions.

Whether LuL.to’s customers still face criminal consequences is also the subject of further investigations.<br>The two alleged main perpetrators were found to have large holdings of cryptocurrencies allegedly linked to the profitable operation of LuL.to and other criminal activities during the course of the investigation. These cryptocurrencies were sold in the first half of 2018 on behalf of the central office Cybercrime Bayern. The proceeds of the sale totalled just over EUR 12 million. The extent to which the proceeds of the sale are to be used to satisfy the claims of injured parties, to benefit the public treasury or to be returned to the accused will not be determined in a judgment until the main hearing has been concluded.

Even if there is a high investigative burden in the field of computer and information technology in general crime proceedings, the prosecutors of the central office take action.
