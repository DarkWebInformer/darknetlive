The DEA’s investigation into the 25-year-old involved some bizarre characters in unrelated court cases, weird neighbors, and a handful of unknowns.<br><span class="font-bold">Gun Charges in New York </span><br><br>The Criminal Complaint revealed that, in reality, law enforcement did little to nothing at all. Confidential informants provided most of the information. In fact, no law enforcement agency investigated Yensan until the arrest of Patrick Allen, a 24-year-old from New York who had worked with Matthew Yensan for years. In January 2017, Allen, according to court documents, was caught in shooting automatic weapons in the woods in Charleston, New York. The gun charges led to drug charges. According to a source close to the case, Allen gave prosecutors information on Yensan and the prosecutors, in return, agreed to drop an 11 counts of assorted drug charges.Patrick Allen <br>Allen and his friend Jonathan Derbyshire brought a Bushmaster “AR-15,” a Glock 26, several pistols of an undisclosed make, body armor, and assorted controlled substances into some woods in the middle of the night. At one in the morning, someone called the police with a “shots fired” complaint.<br>When the police arrived, Derbyshire fled. Allen, dressed in body armor, turned and pointed a Glock 26 at the police. The police shot him four times; three shots entered his leg and one hit his vest. The police took him to the hospital and captured Derbyshire. The police later executed a search warrant at Allen’s home on Kreischer Street in Staten Island, New York. They found “more than 2,000 oxcycodone and alprazolam pills, 16 ounces of marijuana, ammunition and drug packing material,” <a class="link" href="https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20170202/charleston/patrick-allen-indictment-police-shooting-jonathan-derbyshire-liam-allen/" target="_blank">court document revealed</a>.<br>Allen was hit with a 23-count indictment for menacing, illegally wearing a bulletproof vest, weapons possession, and several drug charges. The drug charges stemmed from the search of Allen’s house. He was also under investigation for buying marijuana from Colorado and shipping it to New York for resale. “T]he warrant did not sufficiently describe the premises to be searched,” a filing from Allen’s attorney read. A New York judge later dropped all eleven drug charges against Allen. Derbyshire faced 15 different gun, drug, and related charges. He cut a deal, pleaded guilty to only one gun charge, and received sentence of one year in jail.<br>A source close to Yensan and the case revealed that Allen was Yensan’s partner and friend. I will leave out some background to preserve the privacy of others involved. However, the two had known each other for years. According to the source, Allen provided investigators with a statement on Yensan’s drug trafficking operation in North Carolina. In many proffered deals where a suspect provides information on a more valuable target, the agreement between prosecutors and the defendant is not complete until the information from the suspect leads to a conviction (and/or sentencing). <span class="font-bold">Yensan was sentenced in June 2018. Allen’s drug charges were dropped in August 2018</span>.<hr><br><span class="font-bold">The DEA in Charlotte </span><br><br>DEA Agent Matthew Pearson learned from a DEA Tactical Diversion investigator in Charlotte, North Carolina, that Matthew Yensan was “<span class="italic">mass producing Xanax on several pill presses and selling the pills on the Dark Net</span>.” According to the criminal complaint written by Agent Pearson, the information came from a DEA Source of Information (SOI).<br>A source close to Yensan provided me with the North Carolina informant was using at the time of Yensan’s arrest, but the person’s real name remains unknown (to me). This informant, the source said, had known Yensan for a long time and had helped Yensan since the Silk Road era. This fits the timeline provided by the DEA Agent who stated that “evidence suggest[ed] that YENSAN has been dealing illegal narcotics since 2011.<br><br>In 2013, Yensan posted on Facebook about using Bitstamp, a cryptocurrency exchange.<br><span class="font-bold">July 2017</span>: The North Carolina informant told the DEA Tactical Diversion investigator in Charlotte that Yensan had been selling pills on the darknet. The informant stated that he/she (the informant <span class="font-bold">is a he</span>) had helped move Yensan multiple pill presses to storage unit 165 in Raleigh located at 404 Gorman Street, Raleigh, NC<br><br>According to my source, the informant had helped Yensan repair jammed presses and had effectively mentored Yensan for years. By July 2017, Yensan had finished selling Xanax on the darkweb. The source told me that Yensan had informed the DEA SOI that he was selling his equipment and needed a piece of equipment fixed. The DEA SOI met with Yensan, stayed at his house, and later went to the storage facility where Yensan had been keeping the pill presses.<br>The informant later relayed this information to his DEA contact.<br>“<span class="italic">Through surveillance and investigative methods it was determined that Yensan resides at 8709 Hidden View Court, Raleigh, NC.Yensan has been observed at Ample Storage located at 404 Gorman Street, Raleigh, NC entering storage unit #165,</span>” court documents revealed.<hr><br><span class="font-bold">The DEA Conducts Surveillance </span><br><br><span class="font-bold">August 9, 2017</span>: DEA Special Agent Boucher observed Yensan arrive at the storage unit in a Chevrolet Colorado, one of the vehicles registered to him, and retrieve a bag from unit number 165.<br><span class="font-bold">August 22, 2017</span>: Wake County Sheriff’s Officers stopped two individuals who had just left Yensan’s neighborhood for a traffic violation. Both were arrested for possession with intent to manufacture/sell/distribute heroin. They were also in possession of approximately two grams of marijuana. Both sources stated that they had just been to 8709 Hidden View Court, Raleigh NC, and purchased the narcotics from “Matt and Dylan.” At the time, Yensan was dating Dylan Cummins. The two are now married.<br>The sources additionally stated that Dylan had bragged that her<br>boyfriend Matt was <span class="font-bold">ordering several pounds of marijuana at a<br>time using the Internet</span>. A few days later while researching<br>this Hidden View Court address, SA Boucher met YENSAN’ s<br>neighbor, who wanted authorities to know that the YENSAN’s house<br><span class="font-bold">frequently received suspicious deliveries</span>.

He registered the company in 2013. The source confirmed that Yensan had been selling or otherwise involved in drug trafficking on the darkweb since Silk Road.<br>OPSEC-wise, Yensan did a lot of things by the book. Rarely do package recipients turn down packages when law enforcement conducts a controlled delivery. Yet, that did not matter since a judge had already signed a search warrant for Yensan’s house. The DEA just wanted signed proof that Yensan had ordered drugs from a source likely on the darkweb. They did not get that proof nor did they get a marijuana-related conviction. He also frequently posted on Reddit about Trezor, Litecoin, Bitcoin, and DMT. The DEA may not have found that information as it was under an alias, but it did not take me long to find.<br>A source told me that two confidential informants provided a total of three statements used to convict Yensan. The source believes that the statement used in the probable cause affidavit for the search warrant may have been fabricated as it was not used except for obtaining a search warrant. It was not even mentioned otherwise.<hr><br><span class="font-bold">?</span>: If Patrick Allen was under investigation for buying weed from someone in Colorado, having it shipped to New York, and then reselling it, could the Postal Inspectors have seized a package of marijuana sent to Yensan by Allen at the DEA’s instruction?<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
