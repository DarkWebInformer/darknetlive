See how Hugbunter vouched for Darknetlive after the transfer to the new team, his PGP-signed vouch below. It is easy to come to the conclusion that Hugbunter has alternative motive behind the recent accusations.<br><br><p class="border border-gray-700 p-1">-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Signed by HugBunter on February 16th, 2023.<br><br>I have been made aware of a lot of FUD posts and misinformation floating around regarding DarkNetLive.com and the Admin who took over the role there following the departure of the original Admin.<br><br>I understand why these messages have been spread, but they have been based on misplaced judgements from many and it has snowballed to complete lies. Some of the mistrust may have even stemmed from my own comments, which were personal grievances along with some other service operators. This was simply based on caution towards the new operator, taking the place of an Admin many of us had the pleasure of working closely with for many years while he independantly shared accurate Dark Net news among other things.<br><br>There is no evidence and I do not believe that the current DarkNetLive Admin has any malicious intentions and has continued to operate the site as a neutral source, providing the service as it was originally intended and continuing to amicably share both verified news and hidden service links.<br><br>This is a vouch that as of this current time, I see no wrong doing and simply want to assist in dispelling misinformation, that the take over of the site was not forceful by any means. The service was handed over under good terms from the original Admin which I lay witness to.<br><br>- -HugBunter<br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iQIzBAEBCgAdFiEEYTOs4fS4fFHb8/6l6GEFEPmm6SIFAmPuTNsACgkQ6GEFEPmm<br>6SKwAw/9ErklYi2InLjVrYHSO6vNEGBXYD6U7ZfaT51F1XxGUuomZhZGloWiKost<br>/QnFhbtwL4hzHKTUJvW9Yaj67ih9j8s2QsobIi2D4zpJKHotCb6sXM5xPEnb5Mcv<br>0+qA7oMcgLE0Lw5It8ZBqMch7s9vZDL9jTVA5KDSFXryjVOGL8MMJVOpVJ4P6cGJ<br>Fi2R4tmo5DyaeDQOH+lyeF8H0rM67MlP+nCxf2cRIoL2GZLLDm72WKlvk6L5Y85q<br>KPEFkYfkLNP6/Vhzoex+Fk6jKpxsetbKUGMc+v/1YHz5T9DfttfLCH/zRaiA6qRF<br>Zq+pv44fvhehwvKta5oxIqx3kfrlxDOy96ZTUmqT8eoHhDBSUlVXod+kvuDSXO0X<br>JtselonKbWmWYqCTQ60gx7d+SVNb8mc6ohXdMBIqPTfVzWFC/Q2a+iOjC8NoA9ZO<br>JPXCgRx7WlM5JmGV26le5YUP3GBmp0rPUex0UKMPPTfdlozGAcM+1ACqwnQ8Qbl2<br>BaJ0jYncM4ExSR7k/LaNTJRKRwM0PjoLN0uGmC0LWSAAN/xOZN301mUm/oUP/UfU<br>SXfGXpRALbjjvX9EOJhX1lBzak3HyigP1rqc2ieaRbLIEDv1/PHPncqw+tjhtQOk<br>IvqOua7phY5Fh6ZsLZGg/ANbiy8/Maq2DwswOCh+TpCMCYk+iPk=<br>=EkKb<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</p></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
