Mottram's sentence stemmed from her work as an intelligence analyst for NWROCU during Operation Venetic investigations. Investigations revealed that Mottram was sharing information on the operation with EncroChat users. <br>Operation Venetic was based on information acquired from law enforcement's ability to monitor communications made through EncroChat. In the course of the operation, the investigators established that intelligence information from the operation was being leaked.<br>The investigators made the discovery on April 24, 2020, after an unnamed suspect messaged another EncroChat user and told them that he had received information about the platform's infiltration by LE.<br>The unnamed suspect also messaged a second suspect and said, "I no a lady who works for the police. This is not hearsay. Direct to me. They can access Encro software. And are using to intercept forearms only at the moment. There software runs 48 hours behind real time. So have ur burns one day max. And try to avoid giving postcodes over it. Her words was are you on Encro, I said no why, I only sell a bit of bud. She said cool just giving you heads up. Because NCA now have access. But she wouldn’t lie."<br>The investigators later established that Mottram had been giving 39-year-old Jonathan Kay, information about the operation.<br>After suspecting Mottram, the investigators asked her to analyze false intelligence on Kay, on June 12, 2020, and placed her under surveillance.<br>Mottram left work and went to Kay's home later that day. She let herself in with a key the couple had given her and waited for Kay's arrival. Kay arrived in the evening, and Mottram gave him the bogus information.<br>On receiving the information, Kay's wife called an unnamed suspect. Kay and the suspect met later at a car park and talked for 20 minutes.<br>The investigators arrested the suspects later that day and seized £200,000 in cash from Kay's home.<br>Mottram <a class="link" href="intelligence-analyst-tipped-off-suspects-of-operation-venetic--2edd849c.html" target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice, and unauthorized access to computer material at Liverpool Crown Court, on August 18, 2023. Kay pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice.<br>Kay was sentenced to two years and six months in prison on November 3, and charges against his wife dropped.<br>Mottram was sentenced to three years and nine months in prison.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
