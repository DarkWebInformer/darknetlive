Investigations by the DEA identified eight distribution rings used by Singh. Sigh shipped drugs to individuals in these rings and later gave them instructions on where to mail the drugs according to orders he received on his vendor accounts. Sigh paid the re-shippers through PayPal, cash in the mail, or crypto.<br>In January 2017, the DEA <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ohsd.208674/gov.uscourts.ohsd.208674.3.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">identified one of Sigh's re-shippers</a>, Amanda Trull. Investigations revealed that from October 2015 to December 2016, Trull had mailed over 4,200 packages to 2,500 different addresses in the US, Canada, Jamaica, and Ireland. <br>A search warrant executed at Trull's residence resulted in the seizure of 59 kilograms of MDMA, 14 kilograms of Ketamine, and other drugs.<br>On being questioned, Trull told the investigators she had been receiving the drugs from someone she knew as Liston. She said she communicated with Liston via Wickr and email. She also admitted she knew Liston was a dark web drugs vendor. <br>Further investigations led to the identification of multiple Gmail accounts used by Sigh to communicate with the reshippers. the emails included <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="600c0913140f0e09130805120520070d01090c4e030f0d">[email&#160;protected]</a>, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e082818e8d858594ce858c968993a0878d81898cce838f8d">[email&#160;protected]</a>, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b1ddd8c2c5dedfd8c2d9d4c3d4c2d0ddd4c2f1d6dcd0d8dd9fd2dedc">[email&#160;protected]</a> and <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cba7a2b8bfa4a5bba3aab9a6aa8baca6aaa2a7e5a8a4a6">[email&#160;protected]</a>.<br>In the UK, the NCA established that Sigh operated several pharmaceutical businesses in the UK. Their surveillance revealed he did not lead an extravagant lifestyle. The investigators executed a search warrant at his residence in April 2019.
