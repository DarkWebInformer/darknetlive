Postal Inspectors are steadfast in their commitment to protecting the American public, and USPS employees, from the hazards of drugs in the mail,” said Rho.<br>“This sentence sends a strong message to dark Web merchants of illegal goods that law enforcement is coming for them,” said Steven Osborne, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation.<br>This case was investigated by the Denver Illicit Digital Economy Working Group, comprised of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Internal Revenue Service, in partnership with the Romanian Central Anti-Narcotics Unit in Bucharest, Romania, and the Belgian Federal Judicial Police, East Flanders Drug Unit in Dendermonde, Belgium.
