Shipp at the Trenton federal court. The jury found Tablack guilty of one count of manufacturing, supplying, and possessing with intent to manufacture and distribute cyclopropyl fentanyl pills. He was also found guilty of one count of conspiracy to Manufacture and Distribute Fentanyl pills.<br><img src="../images/social-logo-18008933.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500"> </p><br><br>Tablack’s conviction was based on evidence acquired during investigations conducted by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (<a class="link" href="../taskforces/ocdetf/index.html" target="_blank">OCDETF</a>). Investigators reportedly established that Tablack and his accomplice, Stephan Durham, 43, of Altadena, California, operated a fentanyl pill production facility from as early as March 2017 through December 2017.<br>The duo manufactured hundreds of thousands of fentanyl pills and distributed them throughout the US via the darkweb under the “XanaxKing2” vendor name. The vendor sold approximately 400,000 of the pills every month.<br>The investigations that led to Tablack’s conviction began as an investigation into the distribution of fentanyl in New Jersey launched by the DEA. The DEA investigators executed a search warrant on a residence in Monmouth County, New Jersey, and seized large quantities of a wide variety of drugs including approximately 300,000 cyclopropyl fentanyl pills.<br><img src="../images/fent-33533823.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500"> </p><br><br>The investigators later found out the fentanyl pills had allegedly been shipped to the owner of the residence by Tablack. The investigators intercepted several packages mailed to Monmouth County by Tablack in September 2017. After opening the packages, investigators found a total of 226,520 cyclopropyl fentanyl pills with a total weight of approximately 20 kilograms.<br>Further investigations revealed that Tablack had been running a massive pill production facility in California. The investigators acquired shipping records that showed that Tablack had purchased at least nine pill press machines that he had shipped to an industrial property in California. The industrial property had been leased by a company run by Tablack’s accomplice, Durham.<br>The investigators also found out that Tablack had been purchasing large quantities of fentanyl from a lab in China. The lab shipped the fentanyl disguised as food and beauty products packages to properties controlled by Tablack and Durham. The investigators allegedly intercepted several packages sent from Asia to the properties. The interceptions resulted in the seizure of undisclosed quantities of fentanyl.<br>[img=] [/img]<br><br>Tablack and Durham were <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210510105417/https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-california-men-charged-large-scale-opioid-distribution-ring" target="_blank">arrested</a> on December 20, 2017. They were each charged with one count of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl analogue pills. Tablack was also charged with one count of manufacturing and distributing fentanyl analogue pills.<br>The jury found Tablack guilty of the two charges leveled against him on July 14, 2021.
