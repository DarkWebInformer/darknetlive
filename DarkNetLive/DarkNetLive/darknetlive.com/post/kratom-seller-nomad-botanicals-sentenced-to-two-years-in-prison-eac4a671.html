As part of his plea, Dailey agreed to forfeit $1,000,000 in illegal proceeds. Today, Judge Judith E. Levy of the Eastern District of Michigan sentenced Dailey to serve two years in prison, followed by three years supervised release.<br>Dailey was the owner and operator of Nomad Botanicals, an online business that sold kratom, which is made from the leaves of a tree indigenous to Southeast Asia, to consumers throughout the United States. In pleading guilty, Dailey admitted that he sold kratom with the intention that it be used as a drug to treat a variety of diseases, including chronic pain, Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Dailey also widely distributed kratom as an opiate withdrawal drug, and as a substitute for drugs of abuse and prescription pills. Dailey further admitted that to circumvent the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulation of drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), Dailey knowingly and fraudulently portrayed his kratom products to the FDA as “incense,” “paint pigment,” and other substances not intended for human consumption. By deceiving the FDA in this manner, Dailey was able to import several tons of kratom into the United States.<br>Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division:<br>“We will not tolerate the importation or misbranding of drugs and other products without proper regulatory approvals. The Department of Justice will continue to work with the FDA to ensure that drug distributors do not put consumers at risk by circumventing their obligations under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.”<br>The Plea Agreement <br>As part of his plea agreement, Dailey further admitted that he repackaged and labeled the illegally imported kratom in his residence, which he did not register as a facility that manufactured, prepared, and processed drugs, as required under the FDCA. Dailey then sold and shipped kratom products to consumers throughout the United States for use as a drug without providing any directions for use, such as indications, dosage instructions, methods of administration, or contraindications.<hr>Nomad Botanicals <br><a class="link" href="http://archive.is/GWSxP" target="_blank">Nomad Botanicals</a> was a popular supplier of kratom in powder and in capsule format.<br>Reddit users noticed Dailey’s absence in 2017, not long after the supplier had offered kratom in bulk quantities to customers on Reddit.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
