According to court documents, <a class="link" href="california-man-to-plea-guilty-to-hiring-a-hitman/index.html" target="_blank">Berkett met a woman online</a> in the summer of 2020. In October 2020, the woman flew to Los Angeles to have sex with the defendant.<br>Once the woman returned to her home, she allegedly tried to end things with Berkett.<br><img src="../images/mug-60080987.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Scott Berkett</p><br><br>In April 2021, a family member of the woman called and texted Berkett’s father about Berkett.<br>Later, Berkett’s found a purported murder-for-hire site on the darkweb. He hired a hitman for $13,000 to kill the “victim.” In the order description, Berkett wrote that he wanted the hit to:<br>“look like an accident, but robbery gone wrong may work better. So long as she is dead. I’d also like for her phone to be retrieved and destroyed irreparably in the process. I would like proof of her death sent to me. She has a distinctive tattoo on one of her forearms that I know the image of, so a photo of her corpse and a photo of her tattoo for identification would work. I’ll refrain from sending a picture of the tattoo to avoid doctored photos. If possible, letting me know if she was in Arizona or Idaho wuld also be appreciated so I can also verify via the obituaries.”<br><br>A media organization investigating murder-for-hire sites on the darkweb later contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Berkett’s hit. The media organization had identified the woman as the intended victim through the information Berkett had provided the administrator of the site, including “the identity and location of Victim 1, as well as social media accounts, nicknames, email, and a distinctive tattoo of Victim 1.”<br>Using blockchain analysis software, investigators identified Coinbase as the source of the $13,000 payment. Coinbase records identified Berkett as the owner of the account in question.<br>The FBI contacted the woman about the hit and Berkett. She told the FBI that she had flown to Los Angeles, where she had slept with the defendant. She described his behavior as “sexually aggressive.” After she left L.A., she stopped responding to Berkett’s messages. She complained that Berkett had attempted to contact her on “multiple social media and communications platforms” to get a response.<br>Posing as the hitman Berkett had hired on the darkweb, an undercover employee of the FBI contacted Berkett over WhatsApp. Berkett repeatedly incriminated himself in the conversations with the undercover fed.<br><span class="font-bold">UC</span>: “Hi.
