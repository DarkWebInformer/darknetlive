From April 2018 to late 2019, the investigators made multiple undercover purchases from the defendant's vendor profiles. The investigators also seized multiple drug packages mailed by the defendants and their accomplices.<br>The investigations revealed that the defendants run a large-scale counterfeit oxycodone pill production operation. The investigators established that the defendants used PayPal accounts and credit cards in their names to purchase equipment for their pill production lab from merchants on eBay and Amazon.<br>They reportedly distributed over 1 million of the fentanyl-laced pills.
