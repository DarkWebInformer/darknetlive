The investigators also found and seized manuals on the production of explosives and methamphetamine.<br>Further investigations revealed that the buyer inquired through email about purchasing 500 grams of Semtex, C-4, and four detonators from the US-based vendor. The investigators also found out that the defendant had distributed dextroamphetamine and GBL through the darkweb.<br>The public prosecutor asked the court to sentence the defendant to a total of 3 years in prison, of which one year will be conditional. The prosecutor also demanded that the defendant forfeit 311,797 euros.<br><a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/XJap0" target="_blank">archive.is</a> <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220330200333/https://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuws/2022/03/21/om-eist-36-maanden-gevangenisstraf-voor-poging-invoer-handgranaten" target="_blank">archive.org</a><hr><br>[DNL: That Europol picture is a genuine Europol graphic by the way.]<br><img src="../../images/faggots-67515542.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">kek.</p><br><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
