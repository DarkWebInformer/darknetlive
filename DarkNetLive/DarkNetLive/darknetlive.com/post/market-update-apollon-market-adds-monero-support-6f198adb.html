Markets are shifting towards Monero adoption as a result of law enforcement’s ability to investigate and identify the some darkweb vendors through the Bitcoin blockchain.<br>In an announcement in late July, the marketplace revealed that an update bringing Monero to the market would be rolled out in the near future. On 7 August, 2019, an Apollon Market moderator posted an update on the marketplace’s subdread titled (in part) “<a class="link" href="http://kzu6yzouezayt2pb.onion/post/9afb99d0477e1d79a4fd" target="_blank">XMR (Monero) - Going live TODAY!</a>”<img src="../images/apollon-xmr-deposit-34819842.jpg"><br><span class="font-bold">Deposit XMR on Apollon</span><br>Apollon's XMR Deposit Screen[/img]<br>“We are glad, extremely happy and super excited to announce that XMR (Monero) has been implemented and will be going live today,” the moderator wrote. “The finishing touches have been completed at the time of writing this message so expect to see XMR activated on the market within the next few hours.” As of the publication of this article, the XMR update has completely rolled out and vendors are are adding the option for XMR to their listings.<br>Staff pointed out that vendors needed to manually enable XMR for their listings in the event that some vendors might prefer not to accept the privacy coin. Vendors received the following message from staff in their private inbox on the market:<br>Greetings vendor, This is a message to let you know that XMR has been finally added to our platform. If you would like to accept XMR just go to [the listings page] and click on edit, then select YES on Accept XMR. If you have too many listings or want an admin to automatically enable XMR on all your listings just go to /support.php and open a ticket, have a nice day.<br><br>As noted in the message, the market administration can enable XMR for all listings on a vendors account if requested by the vendor.<img src="../images/apollon-xmr-vendors-23643619.jpg"><br><span class="font-bold">Apollon Adding XMR to Listings</span><br>Apollon Adding XMR to Listings[/img]<br>Apollon is joining the recent group of darkweb markets with Monero integration.

The data broker–a vendor on Apollon Market–claimed possession of almost seven million stolen records from a StockX database.<br>The seller provided TechCrunch a sample of 1,000 records. We contacted customers and provided them information only they would know from their stolen records, such as their real name and username combination and shoe size.
