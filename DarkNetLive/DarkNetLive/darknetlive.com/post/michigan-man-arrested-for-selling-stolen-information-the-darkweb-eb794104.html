According to court records, customers filed false tax returns and claimed tax refunds.<br>[img=]Johnson Worked for FEMA According to His Facebook and LinkedIn Profiles[/img]<br>The 43-count indictment alleges that Johnson first hacked into the HR database of UPMC on December 1, 2013. He stole the personal information of more than 23,500 UPMC employees during the first breach. Johnson then hacked into the UPMC HR database regularly between January 21, 2014, and February 24, 2014, and stole the information of thousands of UPMC employees.<br><br>Between December 11, 2013, and April 12, 2014, Johnson allegedly listed the stolen information on the Evolution darkweb marketplace. Johnson allegedly operated under the aliases “DearthStar” and “TheDearthStar." An example of a listing from TheDearthStar is copied below:<br><span class="font-bold">US identity Fullz + 2013 W-2 [Pack of 10]</span><br><br>Description $3 each Name Address City State Zip SSN DOB Federal State/City W-2 Information (includes employer EIN and address) Provided but unverified data: Marital Status<br><br>!!!The majority of this listing will originate from Pennsylvania!!!<br><br>Johnson deposited his earnings into an account with Coinbase.

After his hack, Johnson then sold UPMC employees’ PII to buyers around the world on dark web marketplaces, who in turn engaged in massive campaign of further scams and theft. His theft left over 65,000 victims vulnerable to years of potential financial fraud. Hackers like Johnson should know that our office will pursue you relentlessly until you are in custody and held accountable for your crimes.<br><br>The indictment alleges that after the UPMC hack in 2014, Johnson continued to hack companies and sell stolen information on darkweb marketplaces.
