The ring members in Germany would then mail the drug packages through German post offices and mailboxes located near the Netherlands border.<br>In September 2018 the Public Prosecutor in Munster launched an investigation against the ring’s drug trafficking operation. The nature of the ring’s operation and interest from Dutch authorities led to the formation of a joint investigation team in November 2018. The joint investigation team was made up of agents from the Dutch Specialized Prosecution Office for Fraud and Environmental Crime, the Dutch Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service (FIOD), the German Public Prosecutor’s Office, Munster, and the German Customs Office.

The raids led to the seizure of 40 kilograms of amphetamine, 1 kilogram of ecstasy pills, an undisclosed number of electronic devices and sales records. The investigators also seized 10,000 Euros in cash and arrested 12 members of the ring.<br>On December 5 nine members of the ring appeared before <a class="link" href="https://www.wn.de/Muensterland/Kreis-Borken/Gronau/4055241-Drogen-ueber-Darknet-gehandelt-und-von-Gronau-aus-verschickt-Zehn-Jahre-Haft-fuer-Dealer" target="_blank">the District Court of Münster for sentencing</a>.
