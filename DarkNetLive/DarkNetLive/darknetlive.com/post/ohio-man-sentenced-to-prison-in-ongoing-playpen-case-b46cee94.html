During the investigation into the darkweb child abuse forum known as “Playpen,” the FBI took over and operated the forum, ensnaring unsuspecting forum users. They also deployed malware to thousands of computers connected to the Tor network.

For the reasons that follow, all three motions will be DENIED.<br>[…]<br><span class="font-bold">Disclosure of Discovery </span><br><br>The Court will adopt the reasoning set forth in Judge Rice’s opinion in Gaver, as it persuasively addresses not only the issue of suppression, but also the request for discovery of the NIT source code and a request for a Franks hearing. In addition, the facts underpinning Gaver’s prosecution are very similar. Gaver was charged with numerous counts of possession of child pornography, knowingly accessing with intent to view child pornography, and knowing receipt of child pornography. Id. at *1. The government deployed NIT onto Gaver’s computer after he logged onto the PlayPen website during the period in time when the government was operating the site from a server in Virginia for the purpose of its investigation. Id. After obtaining Gaver’s IP address and uncovering Gaver’s identity, a warrant was obtained to search his apartment in Dayton, Ohio, which uncovered computers and other items. Id. Like Spicer, Gaver filed a Motion to Suppress Evidence Based on Unconstitutional Deployment of Government-Sponsored Malware Dubbed the “Network Investigative Technique,” a Motion for Disclosure of Discovery, and a Second Motion to Suppress Evidence and Motion for Franks Hearing. Id. All three motions were denied.<br>Even he had, the law enforcement privilege applies, as disclosure of the exploit and server component would severely compromise future investigations and could allow others to develop counter-measures. Id. at *3-4. Defendant’s Motion for Disclosure of Discovery (Doc. 39) is, therefore, DENIED.<br><span class="font-bold">Suppression of NIT Evidence </span><br><br>Spicer moves the Court to suppress all evidence flowing from the Government’s deployment of the NIT software on his computer, including the search of his home and statements obtained from him. Spicer argues that the deployment was an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment.<br>[…]<br>In opposition, the government argues that (1) Spicer did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his IP address and therefore no search occurred; (2) even if a search did occur, the Magistrate Judge had authority under Rule 41(b) (4) to issue the NIT Warrant; (3) even if there was a Rule 41 violation, suppression is not the appropriate remedy; and (4) regardless, the evidence should not be suppressed under the good-faith exception of United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984).<br><span class="font-bold">Suppression of Evidence in Support of the NIT </span><br><br>Spicer argues that the Government intentionally or recklessly made false and misleading statements and omitted material facts in Macfarlane’s Affidavit in support of the NIT Warrant, requiring suppression and a Franks hearing. Macfarlane averred that upon arrival at the PlayPen website, a user would see “images of prepubescent females partially clothed and whose legs are spread with instructions for joining the site before one can enter.”<br>[…]<br>As to the change in the PlayPen website homepage, the Court has reviewed the differences between the two PlayPen homepages and agrees with Judge Rice that they are not materially different. Both include images that “are highly suggestive of the website’s illegal contents, particularly when paired with the website’s name, and the fact that it was accessible only through the Tor network.” Gaver, 2017 WL 1134814 at *6. “In short, even with an accurate description of the website’s logo[/images], probable cause would have existed for the issuance of the warrant.” Id. The Court is not satisfied that the Defendant has shown the false statement was made knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth to warrant a Franks hearing. Id. at *5.<br>The Court also disagrees with Spicer that Macfarlane’s Affidavit contained false and misleading statements about the location of the NIT searches for the reasons set forth by the Court in Gaver. Thus, Spicer is not entitled to a Franks hearing on this ground, either. Id. at *7. Finally, as in Gaver, the Court rejects the argument that the NIT Warrant is an unconstitutional “general” warrant. Id. at *13. For these reasons, Defendant’s Second Motion to Suppress and Motion for Franks Hearing (Doc. 64) also is DENIED.Conclusion <br>This Court adopts the ruling of Judge Rice in United States v. Gaver, 3:16-cr-088, 2017 WL 1134814 (Decision and Entry, Mar. 27, 2017), and, in so doing, DENIES all three of Defendant’s pending motions: Motion for Disclosure of Discovery (Doc. 39), Motion to Suppress Based on Unconstitutional Deployment of Government Sponsored Malware Dubbed the “Network Investigative Technique” (Doc. 40), and Second Motion to Suppress Evidence and Motion for Franks Hearing.<hr><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
