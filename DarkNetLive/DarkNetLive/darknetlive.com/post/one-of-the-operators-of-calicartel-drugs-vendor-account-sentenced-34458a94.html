During the investigations, the investigators made multiple undercover purchases from the vendor accounts and conducted surveillance on the suspected operators of the accounts.<br>In the first purchase, the investigators ordered two grams of cocaine from Calicartel on Dream Market on October 15, 2018. On October 22, they received 2.9 grams of a white powdery substance that tested positive for cocaine. They later found out that the postage label used on the package had been acquired from Encidia, an internet postage provider. The account used to purchase the label belonged to Gabriel Alva, one of Hoffmann's co-conspirators.<br>On January 10, 2019, the investigators purchased 3.5 grams of heroin from "RaiseAppeals" on Dream Market. On January 11, the investigators conducted surveillance at Alva’s residence. They observed Catherine Stuckey, Hoffmann's other accomplice, and Alva exit the residence. Stuckey was carrying a large bin while Alva had a bag. The pair loaded the bin into a car and drove to a local Post Office. <br>At the post office, they dropped off approximately 42 packages, collected free shipping supplies offered by USPS, and drove back to Alva’s residence.<br>A package addressed to the address given to RaiseAppeals during the undercover purchase the previous day was found among the packages. A worker at the post office told the investigators that either Alva or Stuckey or both mailed packages at the post office almost every day.<br>While conducting surveillance at the post office on April 12 and 15, the investigators observed Hoffmann drop off multiple packages at the post office's collection box. The packages dropped by Hoffmann bore the same return address as that on packages mailed by CaliCartel. <br><img src="../images/Hoffmann-mailing-f4bd4416.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Hoffmann carrying drug packages into the post office</p><br>While conducting surveillance at Hoffmann's residence on May 2, the investigators observed Alva arrive at the residence in his car.
