The two main roles that were distributed were those of “Hunters” and “Loopers”.<br>The “hunters” or hunters , were dedicated to the tracking of minors in different social networks, mainly girls between 8 and 14 years of age, focusing their objective on those that allow video broadcasting.<br>Once they chose their objectives, they sent links to rooms created specifically for this purpose on the intervened platform. There, in a coordinated way, the group encouraged the child to broadcast through their webcam, making requests that began as a game to win the confidence of the child.<br>During this phase, the “loopers” came into play . These people had video packages of other minors of both sexes, in which they appeared in different activities. Initially they used images in which the minors appeared in games of their own age and asked their victims to imitate their movements. Subsequently, they used videos of increasingly intense sexual content, including practices of particularly degrading content.<br>Through the previous process they obtained the participation of their victims in this type of practices, recording the activity in video and using them as a hook with other minors.180 years in prison for 38 crimes <br>The first registration made in Spain within the framework of this research was carried out in February 2018 in Alicante. The detainee has recently been tried, having been sentenced to 180 years in prison for 38 crimes of production and distribution of pornographic material with minors, highlighting the sentence itself the “degrading or humiliating character” of the material intervened.<br>The analysis of the material intervened during that first registration allowed to verify that this person exercised a leadership role within their group, establishing rules for the rest of the components, whose non-compliance could even lead to their expulsion.<br>The activity of this person in relation to the minors had a clearly ascending tendency. Initially I downloaded pedophile files through P2P networks . Subsequently, he switched to networks that allow greater anonymity, where he obtained the ideal material to pass himself off as a minor, getting to interact with dozens of them. This activity was developed over the years, progressively increasing the level of perversion of the activities requested of its victims.<br>In October 2018 a second registration was made in the town of Getafe (Madrid). The researcher was at that moment traveling in Southeast Asia, being arrested on his return at the Barajas airport. The analysis of the material intervened during the search allowed the agents to discover that they had used various fictitious identities and deception techniques to capture their victims, all of them minors.Website was administered from Spain <br>In addition to the platform that gave rise to the research, this person had used another of similar characteristics, designed specifically for this type of practice. The minors’ emissions were automatically captured in video, allowing their users to access them later, even if they had not taken part in the activity with the minor.<br>It was also possible to find out that the researcher used a game of initially innocent appearance , where he requested the minors to greet, take out the language or throw a kiss, receiving a different sum of points for each of these actions. As the game progressed, the minors had to undress and perform various behaviors of high sexual content. Among the material intervened, have been found dozens of videos of different minors resulting from the manipulation made with this game.<br>With one of the victims of the detainee in Getafe, the events took place in a more sustained manner over time. In this case, to obtain information from the minor, the researcher used several “phishing” systems , with which he obtained personal data of the minor and even obtained access to his accounts in various social networks and cloud storage systems.<br>The web page used was administered from Spain, whose responsible would have had knowledge of the use that was being made of its platform. Due to these facts, two domiciliary searches have been carried out.<br>The investigation has been carried out by the Department of Telematic Crimes of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
