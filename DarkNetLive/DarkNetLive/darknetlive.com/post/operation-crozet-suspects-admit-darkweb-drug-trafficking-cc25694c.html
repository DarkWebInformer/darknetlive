The investigators reportedly found a total of 15.8 kilograms of MDMA, 2.6 kilograms of cocaine and 1.1 kilograms of ketamine in the packages. The international packages were reportedly addressed to 23 different mailboxes registered to 15 different names.<br>In the course of the operation, the investigators established that Li had rented a two-bedroom unit on Rowell Drive in Mernda. Li and McBeth reportedly used the apartment to store and package illicit drugs. After placing the pair under surveillance, the investigators reportedly saw them making trips to and from the apartment while carrying bags. The duo was also seen in post offices across Melbourne on different occasions.
