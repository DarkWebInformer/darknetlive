We’re not only detecting drugs at the border – together we are stopping those involved in their importation,” Commander Yannopoulos said.<br>“No matter how criminals attempt to conceal and move their drugs, ABF officers have the skills, technology and the resources to find the substances and track down the people who are attempting to bring them in.”<br>ACIC Executive Director Capability Mark Harrison MBE said the National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program continues to indicate a steady increase in the demand for methylamphetamine in Australia.<br>“Wastewater analysis shows regional use of methylamphetamine remains above capital city sites. Understanding these preferences is important to develop and deliver tailored responses to target and disrupt the supply chain.”<br>NSW Police Force State Crime Command Drug and Firearms Squad Commander, Detective Acting Superintendent Michael Cook, said partnerships between law enforcement are critical for joint operations to target drug supply using postal services.<br>“The coordinated efforts over the week of action show that there’s nowhere to run and nowhere to hide if you are using postal services to supply prohibited drugs,” Det. A/Supt Cook said.<br>“The NSW Police Force has some of the most sophisticated technology and resources at our disposal and we will continue to target drug trade at every level of the supply chain.”<br>Investigative leads uncovered throughout Operation Syndal will continue to be examined, and further arrests and charges have not been ruled out.<br>For free and confidential advice about alcohol and other drug treatment services, call the National Alcohol and Other Drug Hotline on 1800 250 015.<br><span class="font-bold">Operation Syndal: National Results summary:</span><br><br><li>26 Search warrants, 46 deterrence door knocks, five arrests on Commonwealth and State charges.</li><li>More than 10,000 mail items searched or scanned nationally.</li><li>Larger seizures included a 4.7kg bulk seizure of methamphetamine at a Victorian search warrant, plus another one kilogram seizure in the lining of a mail item from Mexico destined for a Sydney address.</li><br>Police also had hundreds of small seizures from mail packages nationally, that could have resulted in more than one thousand individual street deals.
