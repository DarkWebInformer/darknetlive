Darknetlive, along with DeepDotWeb and other darkweb news sites, covered this case from start to finish.Sentencing Announcement <br>U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy, Jr. announced today that Terrance Washington, 32, of Elmira, NY, who was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, 100 grams or more of a fentanyl analogue, and witness retaliation, was sentenced to serve 135 months in prison by Chief U.S. District Judge Frank P. Geraci, Jr.<br><br><br><br>Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett A. Harvey, who handled the case, stated that Washington was a distributor in a large-scale opioid manufacturing and trafficking organization in the Southern Tier of New York and northern Pennsylvania between 2015 and May 2017.<br><span class="font-bold">Ordering Opioids on the Darkweb </span><br><br>As part of the conspiracy, the leaders of the organization, Robert Ian Thatcher and Maximillian Sams, imported bulk quantities of furanyl fentanyl, acetyl fentantyl, and U-47700 from overseas suppliers China. They ordered the drugs on what is known as “the dark web,” and used different people and addresses in New York and Pennsylvania to receive the shipments. Thatcher and Sams purchased equipment and materials – including pill presses/mechanical tableting machines, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose magnesium stearate, and powdered food coloring – which they used to manufacture tens of thousands blue pills containing furanyl fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl and U-47700. The pills were made to look like legitimate 15 milligram and 30 milligram Percocet pills.<br>At least two individuals – a 21 year-old female, and a 25 year-old male – died after ingesting the blue pills containing furanyl fentanyl and U-47700. In addition, at least one individual overdosed on more than one occasion after using the blue pills manufactured and distributed by the organization, but survived after being treated by first responders with Narcan.<br>Thatcher and Sams used residences at 604 South Lehigh Avenue in Sayre, Pennsylvania, and 665 Sawdey Road in Catlin, NY, to manufacture and process the pills for distribution. During the execution of a search warrant at the Sayre location on May 16, 2017, law enforcement agents recovered, among other things, 244 blue pills containing furanyl fentanyl, four long guns and ammunition. In addition, during the execution of a search warrant at the Catlin location on May 18, 2017, law enforcement agents recovered, among other things, materials used by Thatcher and Sams to manufacture the pills for distribution. During the conspiracy, Thatcher also possessed several firearms at the Pennsylvania location and his residence in Elmira.<br>After manufacturing the pills, Thatcher and Sams would distribute them in large quantities to other co-conspirators – including Washington, Jesus Rivera, Anthony Prettyman, and Dwayne Banks, a/k/a Fizzle, a/k/a Fizz – who would then distribute the pills to various street-level customers in the Elmira area.Interstate Trafficking <br>Sams also supplied pills to an individual in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. As part of the conspiracy, Sams used co-conspirator Anthony Prettyman to transport 5,330 blue pills containing furanyl fentanyl from Elmira to North Carolina in October 2016. On October 25, 2016, in North Carolina, deputies with the Iredell County (NC) Sheriff’s Office conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle in which Prettyman was traveling. During a subsequent search, the deputies recovered and seized a paint can with a false bottom containing the 5,330 blue pills from inside Prettyman’s vehicle.<br>In early 2017, Thatcher arranged for a package of furanyl fentanyl, that he ordered over the dark web, to be sent to Carlito Rios, Jr. On March 13, 2017, Customs and Border Protection officers at the John F. Kennedy International Airport Mail Branch in Queens, NY, examined a United States Postal Service package addressed to co-conspirator Rios at 1015 Oak Street in Elmira. The sender was listed as an entity in China. Upon inspection, the package was found to contain approximately 249 grams of furanyl fentanyl. Sams and Thatcher intended to use the seized furanyl fentanyl to manufacture and distribute additional quantities of the blue pills. As part of the conspiracy, Rios agreed to accept the package of furanyl fentanyl for Thatcher.Witness Retaliation <br>On August 1, 2017, Washington was arrested in Georgia. While in federal custody in Ohio, Washington assaulted an inmate who had been cooperating with the Drug Enforcement Administration in this investigation. Specifically, Washington struck the inmate in the head with closed fists, threw a cup at the inmate, and struck the inmate in the face with the cup. Washington assaulted the inmate in retaliation for the inmate’s cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration in the investigation of Washington and several associates, including Thatcher, Sams, Banks and Rios.<br>In total, 16 members and associates of the opioid manufacturing and trafficking operation have been convicted of federal narcotics offenses and sentenced. The other members of the organization were sentenced as follows:<br><br><li>Thatcher was sentenced to serve 23 years in federal prison;</li><li>Sams was sentenced to 210 months in federal prison;</li><li>Prettyman was sentenced to 125 months in federal prison;</li><li>Banks was sentenced to 108 months in federal prison;</li><li>Rivera was sentenced to 108 months in federal prison;</li><li>Thatcher’s girlfriend, Amber Bates, who was convicted of money laundering conspiracy, was sentenced to five years probation to include six months of home detention;</li><li>Robert J.
