Durham, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that, on September 6, 2018, a federal grand jury in Bridgeport returned an 11-count indictment charging BARRY DUCLOS, 39, of Norwich with fentanyl analogue trafficking and firearm possession offenses.<br>DUCLOS appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons in Bridgeport and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.&nbsp; DUCLOS has been detained since his arrest on a criminal complaint on February 12, 2018.<br>As alleged in court documents and statements made in court, between September 2017 and February 2018, DUCLOS operated a vendor page known as “Dream Market” on the dark web.&nbsp; DUCLOS, using the alias 1NOLEFB1, advertised the sale of fentanyl analogues on Dream Market.&nbsp; He then used the U.S. Mail to ship fentanyl analogues to customers who paid for the drugs using Bitcoin.<br>A search of DUCLOS’s residence at the time of his arrest revealed a YHM rifle with multiple magazines, two of which were extended magazines.&nbsp; The firearm was loaded with a round in the chamber.&nbsp; Investigators also located and seized a quantity of fentanyl from the residence.<br>It is further alleged that DUCLOS was convicted in state court, in February 2001, of sale of narcotics and, in March 2017, of larceny in the third degree.<br>It is a violation of federal law for a person previously convicted of a felony offense to possess a firearm or ammunition that has moved in interstate or foreign commerce.<br>The indictment charges DUCLOS with one count of possession with intent to distribute, and distribution of, 10 grams or more of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, an offense that carries a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years and maximum term of imprisonment of 40 years.&nbsp; The indictment also charges DUCLOS with eight counts of possession with intent to distribute, and distribution of, fentanyl analogues, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years on each count.&nbsp; DUCLOS also is charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and offense that carries a mandatory consecutive five-year term of imprisonment.<br>U.S. Attorney Durham stressed that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.&nbsp; Charges are only allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<br>This matter is being investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&nbsp; The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Richards.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
