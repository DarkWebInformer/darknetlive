Armed with this information. an unscrupulous party can do things like attempt to hack you, kidnap you, torture you, or a competitor can track your company’s revenue. They can also monitor your coins and know where you send them to use that information against you for example if you should use coins on a dating website.<br><br>Instead, to preserve your own personal privacy and dignity you can send us (for example) 1 Bitcoin and receive 0.9949 BTC back into your new wallet that has no traces of your identity on it. Using time delays and multiple addresses ensures nobody will know anything about your coins.<br><br>PrivCoin had a significant number of users, according to forum threads and Reddit posts about the mixer.
