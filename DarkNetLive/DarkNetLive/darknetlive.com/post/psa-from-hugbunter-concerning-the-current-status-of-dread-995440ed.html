We have been working around the clock to keep the platform stable and will continue to do so, but I do want to warn you that the site may go down/be intermittent as the attack has increased over the last 2 hours. In this case, updates will be published to https://reddit.com/r/DreadAlertI will be issuing a single mirror to Dread if we cannot restore service on the main URL, this mirror will include the fixes provided to the main URL and should stay online, due to theorized limitations of the attack.Today I and /u/Paris have worked with Avengers to get their forum back online as they have been consistently attacked alongside Dread.Avengers is an essential harm reduction resource and it is disgusting that it is also being attacked, I can confirm Avengers is now back online and running strong, their URL seems to have disappeared from dark.fail, so here it is for reference:<a class="link" href="http://avengersdutyk3xf.onion/" target="_blank">http://avengersdutyk3xf.onion/</a>Whilst we continue to work on Dread stability, I am also working closely with DarkNetLive to upgrade their platform, which will include mirror checking and distribution, which is very much needed now for market access considering the currently on-going issues with dark.fail. This is definitely a much needed addition so we don't rely on a single source, I implore anyone willing and able to launch their own forum platforms as an alternative to Dread since I cannot guarantee uptime. Another alternative is The Hub:<a class="link" href="http://thehub7xbw4dc5r2.onion/" target="_blank">http://thehub7xbw4dc5r2.onion</a>That is all for now.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----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CE3l-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<hr><br>If a mirror is issued, it will be available on this site as well as on the subreddit /r/DreadAlert.<hr><br><span class="font-bold">Source</span>: dreadditevelidot.onion/post/a50ad80dd504522e0ef4<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
