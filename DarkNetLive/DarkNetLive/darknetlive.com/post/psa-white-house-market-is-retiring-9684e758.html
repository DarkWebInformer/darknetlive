It seems as if their introductory announcement on Dread was not that long ago. White House Market will join the shortlist of markets that retired responsibly.<br>The market, as of this article, had 894,401 user accounts. Of those, 326,570 are active. Based on the responses to the Dread post and the general sentiment of well-known forum members, White House Market will be missed. And the market’s administrator, Mr. White, will certainly have a lasting impact on the community.<br>There are few markets with respectable administrators and Mr. White referenced two of the most well-known examples in his farewell post: <a class="link" href="../markets/monopoly-market/index.html" target="_blank">Monopoly Market</a> and <a class="link" href="../markets/versus-market/index.html" target="_blank">Versus Market</a>.&lt;details id="signed-message"&gt;&lt;summary class="u__s a2w"&gt;Signed Message&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;div class="a2x"&gt;<br>-—-BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE—–&lt;br&gt;Hash: SHA256<br>We have reached our goal and now, according to plan, it’s&lt;br&gt;time to for us to retire.<br>Effective immediately user registration and ordering have&lt;br&gt;been disabled, everything else (yes, withdrawals included)&lt;br&gt;is working as usual.<br>We will keep the market online for a limited time until&lt;br&gt;open orders are finalized, disputes handled and coins&lt;br&gt;withdrawn.
