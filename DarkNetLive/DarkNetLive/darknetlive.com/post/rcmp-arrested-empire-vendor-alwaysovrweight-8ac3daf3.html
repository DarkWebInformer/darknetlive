The vendor sold primarily to customers in Canada.<br><br>AlwaysOvrWeight had a profile on <a class="link" href="../markets/empire-market/index.html" target="_blank">Empire Market</a> where he had an average feedback of 99% and had completed 1,257 orders.&lt;style&gt;.ajr&gt;details{max-height:350px;overflow:auto}&lt;/style&gt;<br>&lt;details class="ajr"&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Empire Market - AlwaysOvrWeight&lt;/summary&gt;<br><span class="font-bold">Total Feedback:</span> 1257<br><span class="font-bold">Rating:</span> 99.89<br><span class="font-bold">PGP Key ID:</span> &lt;code&gt;0894E2C4E24D160328B21676074306792204F319&lt;/code&gt;<br>&lt;/details&gt;<br>Investigators also learned that AlwaysOvrWeight used the handle bcpremo88 on encrypted messaging platforms. They did not explain how this information had helped investigators identify the suspects, though.<br>On February 4, 2020, RCMP officers executed search warrants at two Nanaimo homes. In the first raid, officers located and dismantled a GHB processing laboratory. The house also contained drug packaging and shipping material. During the second raid, officers arrested all three suspects and discovered “evidence of drug trafficking using the dark web.”<br>The RCMP released very little information about the investigation. They noted that investigators had used both “conventional and non-conventional techniques” to link the suspects to the vendor account and that Canada Post had provided the RCMP with “co-operation and support,” police said.<br>“This marks the success of a challenging project. The RCMP in B.C. will continue to work to enhance public safety for all Canadians, in the real and virtual world,” said RCMP Supt. Richard Bergevin.<hr><br>Update One: A user sent an email from AO’s email address with the following content:<br>Hello,<br><br>Please take the article down that says I am arrested.<br>That is not me and I am not associated with whoever is in this article at all.<br>Every minute that your article is up I am losing business which isnt fair at all.<br><br>Update two<br>Dread user <a class="link" href="http://kzu6yzouezayt2pb.onion/post/f7648c6f09ee4d738e24/#c-5e1dede96cce2da6df" target="_blank">/u/AlwaysOvrweight on this topic</a>:<br>What do you know by reading this article?
