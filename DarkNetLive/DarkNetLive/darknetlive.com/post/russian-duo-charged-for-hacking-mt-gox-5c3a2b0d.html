Gox users.<br>According to the <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-06/u.s._v._bilyuchenko_and_verner_indictment.pdf" target="_blank">one-count indictment</a> filed in December 2019, the duo and their accomplices hacked into Mt. Gox's servers in September 2011. Between 2011 and May 2014, the defendants transferred a total of approximately 647,000 bitcoins from Mt. Gox's wallets to Bitcoin addresses under their control.  <br>The defendants and their accomplices moved 530,000 of the bitcoin to their accounts at the now-defunct crypto exchanges, BTC-e and Trade Hill. They also used another wallet at Mt. Gox.  <br>In April 2012, the defendants got into a fraudulent advertising contract with an undisclosed New York-based Bitcoin broker. By April 2013, the broker had allegedly transferred a total of over $6.6 million to overseas accounts controlled by the defendants. In return, the broker received bitcoin from the defendants on BTC-e.<br>In addition to hacking Mt. Gox, Bilyuchenko was charged with running BTC-e in a separate indictment. The <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-06/biluchenko_indicment_redacted_cr-22-0255_vc.pdf" target="_blank">two-count indictment</a> accuses Bilyuchenko of collaborating with Alexander Vinnik and others in the operation of BTC-e. Vinnik was <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/alleged-russian-cryptocurrency-money-launderer-extradited-united-states" target="_blank">extradited to the US</a> from Greece to face <a class="link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.345322/gov.uscourts.cand.345322.1.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">charges</a> in connection to his role in the operation of BTC-e. <br>The indictment claims that from its establishment in 2011 to its shutdown in 2017, BTC-e was used to launder the proceeds of various criminal activities including hacking and drug trafficking. BTC-e was preferred because it did not enforce KYC measures.<br>One of the biggest money laundering schemes conducted through BTC-e was the movement of 300,000 bitcoin stolen from Mt.Gox. The bitcoins were moved through three separate accounts on BTC-e. <br>Verner faces a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bilyuchenko is charged with money laundering conspiracy and operation of an unlicensed money-transmitting business. The whereabouts of the two defendants are unknown.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
