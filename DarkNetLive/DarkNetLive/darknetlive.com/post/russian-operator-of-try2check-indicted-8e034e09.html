For a small fee, the users of the platform could conduct checks and receive a report of how many cards in a batch of stolen credit cards were valid.<br>Investigations into Try2Checkopeartions were launched in 2013 by the FBI and US Secret Service. According to <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-05/cardcheckers_complaint_final.pdf" target="_blank">the complaint</a>, the investigators established that Try2Check exploited the services of an undisclosed US payment processing company. <br>Try2Check used the company's preauthorization services to check the validity of cards. Try2Check impersonated merchants seeking preauthorization services from the company.  <br>In November 2018, an undercover agent used Try2Check's card checking services to check the validity of twenty newly created credit card numbers. <br>The checks for the validity of the cards appeared on the company's preauthorization system. The system revealed that the checks had been conducted by fictitious US-based merchants. The system also revealed that the checks for the cards could be tied to nine IP addresses.<br>The investigators established that between April 13, 2018, and December 31, 2018, the IP addresses had submitted over 16 million credit card numbers for preauthorization requests.<br>To tie Kulkov to the operations of Try2Check, the investigators focused on the user names "Kreenjo" and "Nordex" which advertised card-checking services on multiple carding forums. Nordex and Kreenjo used the same ICQ number. Nordex also identified as Denis from Samara, Russia. The IP address used by Nordex to join the carding forums was of an Internet Service Provider located in Samara, Russia.<br>The investigators later obtained information from an undisclosed cryptocurrency exchange revealing that a user with the username "Nordexin" was on the exchange. The user used the name "Denis Kulkov" and an address in Samara, Russia to open the account. The user provided Kulkov's passport and Russian driver’s license for verification.<br>The exchange also gave the investigators a phone number and two email addresses linked to the Nordexin account.<br>In May 2019, the investigators acquired a search warrant for an undisclosed email hosting and cloud backup services provider associated with one of the Nordexin email addresses.<br>The investigators found out that the account had been used to save screenshots of Try2Check's admin panel. One of the images showed a list of the platform's users and their Bitcoin balances.<br>The account also had multiple emails sent by Kulkov, including to a cryptocurrency exchange he wanted to use to cash out his cryptocurrency. The investigators believe Kulkov made over $18 million in Bitcoin from operating Try2Check.<br><img src="../images/Rewards-a2dd638e.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The rewards by the US Department of State</p><br>The US Department of State <a class="link" href="https://www.state.gov/denis-gennadievich-kulkov/" target="_blank">announced a reward</a> of up to $10 million for information that will result in Kulkov's arrest or conviction.
