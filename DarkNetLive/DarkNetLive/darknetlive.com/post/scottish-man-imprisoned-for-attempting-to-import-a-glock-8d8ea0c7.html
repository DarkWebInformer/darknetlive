On opening it, the agents found a Glock pistol, 200 rounds of ammunition, a laser sight, and a silencer hidden inside a jukebox.<br>The agents informed Police Scotland of the package, seized the weapons, and replaced the <a class="link" href="../tags/Firearms.html" target="_blank">firearm</a> with a dummy. The police in Scotland arrested Baxter at his home after he accepted delivery for the package.<br>On being interviewed, Baxter claimed he did not know that the package had weapons. He later changed his statement and confessed that he had been purchasing cannabis on the dark web. He had somehow accumulated a £3,000 debt to his cannabis vendor. As payment for the debt, the vendor told Baxter he had placed an order for a Glock handgun on the dark web and given Baxter's address as the shipping address. Baxter agreed to receive and keep the package until the vendor collected it.<br>Baxter pleaded guilty to attempting to acquire and possess a firearm and ammunition on May 3, 2023. He was sentenced to three years and one month in prison on May 26.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
