He also claimed that he was feeling suicidal when he placed the order and did not know how to cancel it after he had stopped feeling suicidal.<br>Forensic analysis of Maxwell's electronic devices revealed that he had been searching terms such as "best suicide method," "suicide by gunshot UK" and "primary schools in Glasgow."<br>The investigators also found hundreds of files containing child abuse and bestiality material.<br>Maxwell pleaded guilty to two counts each, of purchasing and attempting to acquire and possess a firearm and buying and attempting to acquire and possess ammunition in September.
