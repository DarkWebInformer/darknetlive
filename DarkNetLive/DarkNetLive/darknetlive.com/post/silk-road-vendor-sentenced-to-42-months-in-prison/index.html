When opening the account Haney gave the exchange his name, social security number, residential address, photo ID, and verified his email address.<br>Between January 26 and February 1, 2018, Haney transferred a total of approximately 1,571.5 Bitcoins and approximately 1,572.7 Bitcoin Cash to the exchange. He later exchanged the cryptocurrency for a total of $19,147,057. The exchange asked Haney to explain how he had acquired the cryptocurrency.

The exchange also reported the case to federal authorities. On November 9, a United States Magistrate Judge issued a warrant that led the seizure of Haney’s funds in the cryptocurrency exchange. The agents also seized the more than $19 million from a custodial account at an undisclosed bank.<br>After tracing Haney’s bitcoins to their source and analyzing Silk Road’s Server Information the federal agents determined that Haney had received at least 3,892.9 Bitcoins directly or indirectly from Silk Road. Of the total received, Haney retained 1,392.9 in his wallet to the end of January 2012.<br><br><br><br>On December 9, a United States Magistrate Judge signed a search warrant for Haney’s residence.
