Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data.”<br><br>“Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people’s privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world.”<br><br>“<span class="font-bold">To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments.</span>”<br><img src="../images/rq-72893858.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">If the Spiegel report is accurate, Telegram will likely change this statement quietly.</p><br><br>According to Spiegel, “it is still difficult for German investigators to obtain information from Telegram” when investigating crimes outside of the scope of purported “terrorism” or child abuse. Since 2018, if not earlier, the company has been moving towards a state of functional compliance with various Western governments. A privacy policy change in 2018 allowed for the disclosure of IP addresses and phone numbers if required by a court.<br>The paragraph below appears under a section titled, “Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With” in <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220605092126/https://telegram.org/privacy#2-legal-ground-for-processing-your-personal-data" target="_blank">the company’s privacy policy</a>.<br><span class="font-bold">Law Enforcement Authorities</span><br><br>“If Telegram receives a court order that confirms you’re a terror suspect, we may disclose your IP address and phone number to the relevant authorities.

AfD, which is basically a “right-wing” platform that opposes mass immigration, is still under investigation regionally.<br>Although Germany is perhaps one step ahead of the United States in legally restricting speech and surveilling innocent citizens, you can be sure all “our values” governments do the same things.

(I believe children’s interests need to be protected, but the U.S. government does not care about most people’s children.)<hr><br>In <a class="link" href="https://nitter.net/disclosetv/status/1532881083070570497" target="_blank">the Disclose.tv thread</a> on Twitter, someone linked to <a class="link" href="https://nitter.net/moxie/status/1474067549574688768?" target="_blank">a thread by Moxie Marlinspike</a>, the creator of Signal. Darknetlive’s <a class="link" href="signals-cryptocurrency-integration-seems-suspicious/index.html" target="_blank">official position on Marlinspike</a> is suspicion. But the points in the thread stand regardless.<br>It’s amazing to me that after all this time, almost all media coverage of Telegram still refers to it as an “encrypted messenger.” Telegram has a lot of compelling features, but in terms of privacy and data collection, there is no worse choice. Here’s how it actually works:<br><br>Telegram stores all your contacts, groups, media, and every message you’ve ever sent or received in plaintext on their servers. The app on your phone is just a “view” onto their servers, where the data actually lives. Almost everything you see in the app, Telegram also sees<br><br>Here’s a simple test: delete Telegram, install it on a brand new phone, and register with your number. You will immediately see all your conversation history, all of your contacts, all the media you’ve shared, all of your groups. How? It was all on their servers, in plaintext<br><br>The confusion is that Telegram does allow you to create very limited “secret chats” (no groups, synchronous, no sync) that nominally do use e2ee, even if the security of the e2ee protocol they use is dubious. There’s no e2ee by default, but they talk about it like there is<br><br>FB Messenger also has an e2ee “secret chat” mode that is actually much less limited than Telegram’s (and also uses a better e2ee protocol), but nobody would consider Messenger to be an “encrypted messenger.” FB Messenger and Telegram are built almost exactly the same way.<br><br>Some may feel okay letting Telegram have access to all of their data, msgs, images, contacts, groups, etc. because they “trust Telegram.” However, the point of an “encrypted messenger” should be that you don’t have to trust anyone other than the ppl you’re communicating with<br><br>Actual privacy tech is not about trusting someone else w/ your data. It’s about not having to. A msg you send should only be visible to you &amp; recipient. A group’s details should only be vis to the other members. Looking up your contacts should not reveal them to anyone else.<br><br>Privacy tech is really about making the tech consistent with the UI. But if Telegram’s UI were consistent with the way the tech worked, every chat would be a group chat with everyone that works at Telegram + everyone that hacks Telegram + every gov that accesses Telegram, etc<br><br>For the folks writing about this space, my request is that when you write “encrypted messenger,” it should at [em]minimum[/em] mean an app where all messages are e2ee by default. Telegram and FB Messenger are built exactly the same way. Neither are “encrypted messengers.<br><hr><br>Telegram is pretty neat but I would certainly register with a burner number and access it with a VPN. Sending “private” messages through the app seems like a mistake though.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
