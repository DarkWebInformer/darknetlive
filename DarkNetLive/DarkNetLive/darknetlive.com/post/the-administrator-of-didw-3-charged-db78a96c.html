In exchange for creating the shop, the defendant would receive a commission of 4% on sales made through the shop, in addition to the payment he would receive for developing it.<br>While developing the darknet shop, the defendant created and administered a drugs shop on the clearnet through which his accomplices distributed the drugs. The investigators believe the trio distributed a total of 3.4 kilograms of ketamine, 1.6 kilograms  of MDMA, over 17,000 ecstasy pills, and more than 7,000 LSD blots through the clearnet shop. The creation of the <a class="link" href="../shops.html" target="_blank">darknet vendor shop</a> was brought to an end by the arrest of one of the defendant's accomplices.<br>The defendant faces a minimum of five years in prison for drug trafficking offenses.  For the charge of operating a criminal trading platform on the internet, he faces a prison sentence of 1 to 10 years.<br>The administrator of the original DiDW was sentenced to six years in prison in 2018. He had operated the forum from 2013 to 2017 when it was shut down by the BKA. He was charged with facilitating the 2016 shooting spree in Munich that left 10 people dead. The shooter had allegedly acquired the gun used in the shooting from a vendor on the forum.  </div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
