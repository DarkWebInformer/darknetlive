Europol supported the takedown with specialist operational analysis and coordinated the cross-border collaborative effort of the countries involved.<br><br>DarkMarket in figures:<br><br><li>almost 500 000 users;</li><li>more than 2 400 sellers;</li><li>over 320 000 transactions;</li><li>more than 4 650 bitcoin and 12 800 monero transferred.</li><br>At the current rate, this corresponds to a sum of more than €140 million. The vendors on the marketplace mainly traded all kinds of drugs and sold counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card details, anonymous SIM cards and malware.<br><br><br><br>DarkMarket used CyberBunker as a hosting provider for the marketplace until law enforcement shut down the hosting provider. Multiple I.P. addresses associated with DarkMarket, including 185.35.137.66, leaked after German law enforcement had seized <a class="link" href="../the-cyberbunker-trial-began-this-week/index.html" target="_blank">the CyberBunker infrastructure</a>. However, the administrators quickly moved the market to servers located in Moldova and Ukraine. The seized CyberBunker servers were the basis of the investigation into the marketplace.<br>This should be an interesting trial. We do not know much about the investigation yet. However, many online have indicated that the administrator of DarkMarket lacked the skills to safely run a criminal marketplace. They did very well for a market based on a freely-available marketplace script and had nearly monopolized the sector at the time of their arrest.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
