In this guide, we will look into how bitcoin works and how you can store and use it.<br><img src="../images/bitcoin-61aee373.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Bitcoin</p><br>Bitcoin operates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network. Transactions are verified and processed by network participants.<br>When one initiates a transaction, the transaction is broadcasted to the bitcoin network. Miners then create a block by adding the transaction to a group of other transactions broadcasted to the network at around the same time. The block is then mined and broadcasted to the network. The other nodes verify that it is valid and conforms to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. <br>To be verified, the block has to adequately reference the previous block in the chain. If a majority of the nodes agree that the block is valid, it is added to the blockchain and becomes part of the permanent record of all Bitcoin transactions.<br>The bitcoin network uses public-key cryptography to secure bitcoin transactions. Each user has two keys a public key also known as the address, which is used to receive bitcoin. The second key is a private key, it is used to sign and authorize transactions. <br>To start using bitcoin, you need a bitcoin address to receive bitcoin and the associated private key to be able to spend the bitcoin you receive. A bitcoin wallet gives you access to the public key and the private key pair you need to make bitcoin transfers.<br>We will now look into how you can install and use Electrum wallet to store bitcoin for your everyday uses.<br><h2>Download and Install Electrum Wallet</h2><br>Go to the <a class="link" href="https://electrum.org/#download" target="_blank">official electrum website</a> and download and install the latest version of the wallet for your operating system.<br><h2>Create a New Wallet</h2> <br><img src="../images/choose-location-a115b5da.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Choose wallet storage location</p><br>Once the app opens, click on choose to select where you want to store your wallet.
