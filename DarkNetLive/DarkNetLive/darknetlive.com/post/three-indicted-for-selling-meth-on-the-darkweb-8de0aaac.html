The defendants are:<br><br><li>Michael Alan Goldberg, 34, of Panorama City, who allegedly directed the conspiracy, even after being taken into federal custody in June 2018;</li><li>Donnica Rabulan, 31, of Panorama City; who is Goldberg’s wife, and</li><li>James Caleb Kueker, 41, of the Hollywood Hills.</li><br>Rabulan, who in addition to the conspiracy charge faces four counts of distributing methamphetamine, was arraigned Monday afternoon in United States District Court. Kueker, who also is charged with one count of possession with the intent to distribute ketamine, as well as with one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, was also arraigned on Monday. Rabulan and Kueker each entered not guilty pleas and were ordered to stand trial on June 4.<br><br>Goldberg, who also faces one count of intentionally distributing methamphetamine, is scheduled to be arraigned on April 8.<br><br>The eight-count indictment followed a criminal complaint filed on March 1 that outlined how the three defendants used the Darknet to purchase narcotics with cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, and then made 59 shipments of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs to international buyers. During the course of the alleged conspiracy, Goldberg was arrested on an unrelated fraud case and was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison on that matter.<br><br>The indictment alleges that Rabulan shipped methamphetamine to international buyers, while Kueker collected tens of thousands of dollars in illicit proceeds from the sales on Goldberg’s behalf.<br>Search warrants executed on March 11 led to the discovery of suspected drug labs at Kueker’s homes in the Hollywood Hills and Valley Village, as well as a loaded AK-47-style rifle in the bedroom of Kueker’s Hollywood Hills residence, court papers state. Federal agents also recovered more than $150,000 in suspected drug proceeds in a safe deposit box registered to Kueker, according to court documents. Three residents of the house were arrested and were charged in separate indictments alleging possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.<br><br>Source: <a class="link" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/three-la-residents-charged-darknet-drug-ring-allegedly-shipped-methamphetamine-buyers" target="_blank">United States Attorney’s Office Central District of California</a><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
