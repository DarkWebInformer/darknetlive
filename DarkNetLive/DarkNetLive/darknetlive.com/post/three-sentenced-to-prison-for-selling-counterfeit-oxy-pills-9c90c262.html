Every drug dealer's dream. | USAO</p><br><br>The trio’s imprisonment stemmed from a tip that resulted in the arrest of a suspect driving from <a class="link" href="https://archive.md/z7MTE" target="_blank">Woolard’s home</a>. After stopping the suspect, police found approximately 3,000 fake oxycodone pills and more than $8,000 in cash.

He retained the role of purchasing and importing fentanyl from China. He had also continued to help Pelayo in the production and distribution of the pills.
