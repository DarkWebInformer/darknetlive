They use a combination of technologies such as zero-knowledge proof, Ring signatures, and mixers to hide their users' identities and transaction amounts. <br><img src="../images/privacy-coins-5f13febc.jpg"><br>They include:<br><h2>Monero (XMR)</h2><br>Monero provides financial privacy and anonymity to its users by default. To do so, <a class="link" href="the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-monero-adab8531.html" target="_blank">Monero</a> uses a combination of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and Ring Confidential Transactions(RingCT).<br>Stealth addresses are one-time addresses generated for each transaction. They make sure a recipient's public address cannot be linked to any transaction. Stealth addresses ensure that only the sender and the receiver know where the funds were sent.	<br>Ring signatures combine a group of signatures, making it difficult to determine who initiated and signed a particular transaction.<br>RingCT is an improvement on Ring signatures that makes the transactions confidential by hiding the amount being transacted.<br><h2>Zcash (ZEC)</h2><br>Zcash does not provide its users with anonymity by default. To use its privacy features, users have to use private addresses (z-addresses), they start with a z.<br>When private addresses are used, Zcash uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect its users' privacy. In zero-knowledge proofs, one can prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any unnecessary information beyond the validity of the statement.<br>Zcash specifically uses a form of zero-knowledge cryptography called <a class="link" href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/" target="_blank">Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge</a> (zk-SNARKs) to provide privacy. Zk-SNARKs allows the sender of a transaction to prove that the transaction meets the conditions of a valid transaction without revealing any information about the sender, receiver, or transaction amount.<br>PirateChain, Horizen, and PIVX also use zero-knowledge cryptography in their private transactions. <br><h2>Verge (XVG)</h2><br>The <a class="link" href="https://vergecurrency.com/static/blackpaper/verge-blackpaper-v5.0.pdf" target="_blank">Verge network</a> integrates both The Onion Router (Tor) and Invisible Internet Project (I2P) into its wallet software to hide the IP addresses of its users.<br>Tor protects your privacy on the internet by routing data through multiple random servers, making it difficult to trace the source of the data. <br>I2P is a decentralized P2P network that allows its users to communicate anonymously. In addition to using end-to-end encryption, I2P uses uni-directional communication tunnels to further protect its users.<br>To further protect the financial privacy of its users, Verge also uses ring signatures and stealth addresses.<br><h2>Grin (GRIN)</h2><br>GRIN is a decentralized privacy-focused cryptocurrency that uses a technology called <a class="link" href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/intro.md" target="_blank">Mimblewimble</a> to provide users with strong privacy protections. Mimblewimble is a type of blockchain protocol that allows for confidential transactions without revealing any identifying information about the sender, receiver, or transaction amount.<br>In the Mimblewimble blockchain, there are no identifiable and reusable addresses. The users generate one-time use addresses for each transaction, which helps prevent address reuse and makes it more difficult to link transactions to specific users.<br>A Mimblewimble block can be treated as one large transaction not a combination of individual transactions. This makes it difficult to trace individual transactions as no information about individual transactions is revealed. Transaction information is only known by the transaction's participants.<br>The privacy-focused coin, Beam, also uses Mimblewimble to provide its users with confidential transactions.<br><h2>Decred (DCR)</h2><br>Decred gives its users the option to use its privacy-focused mixing protocol called <a class="link" href="https://docs.decred.org/privacy/cspp/overview/" target="_blank">CoinShuffle++ (CSPP)</a>.<br>CoinShuffle++ is a non-custodial CoinJoin mechanism whose aim is to hide the real owners of DCR coins. To provide anonymous outputs every mix must have a fixed denomination. This makes it hard to link outputs and inputs.<br>It is worth noting that Decred does not provide confidential transactions. This means that the anonymity provided by CoinShuffle++ is dependent on change outputs being handled correctly.<br>Dash is another cryptocurrency that gives its users the option of using CoinJoin to create anonymity.<br>These privacy coins provide varying levels of privacy. No system can guarantee complete anonymity. You should always assume that the privacy coin you use could one day become traceable.<br>On top of using privacy <a class="link" href="../tags/Cryptocurrency.html" target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a> take these precautionary measures to further protect your privacy;<br><ul><li>Never reuse an address.</li><li>Do not purchase your cryptocurrencies from sources that require KYC.</li><li>Always use a VPN or Tor.</li></ul></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
