The filing is pursuant to President Joe Biden’s Executive Order, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets” and the subsequent Illicit Finance Action Plan released by the Treasury Department last week.”<br><br>“Without appropriate controls and enforcement of existing laws, digital assets can pose a significant risk to national security by facilitating illicit finance, such as money laundering, cybercrime and terrorist actions,” U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said. “As we work to implement the Illicit Finance Action Plan, hold bad actors accountable and identify potential gaps in existing enforcement, we look forward to receiving the public’s input on this urgent work.”<br><br><img src="../images/sifma-70979430.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E.

These principal policy objectives are:<br><li>Protection of consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States.</li><li>Protection of United States and global financial stability and the mitigation of systemic risk.</li><li>Mitigation of illicit finance and national security risks posed by misuse of digital assets.</li><li>Reinforcement of U.S. leadership in the global financial system and in technological and economic competitiveness, including through the responsible development of payment innovations and digital assets. Start Printed Page 57557</li><li>Promotion of access to safe and affordable financial services.</li><li>Support of technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets.</li>Section 7(a) provides that digital assets have facilitated sophisticated cybercrime-related financial networks and activity, including through ransomware activity. The growing use of digital assets in financial activity heightens risks of crimes such as money laundering, terrorist and proliferation financing, fraud and theft schemes, and corruption. These illicit activities highlight the need for ongoing scrutiny of the use of digital assets, the extent to which technological innovation may impact such activities, and exploration of opportunities to mitigate these risks through regulation, supervision, public-private engagement, oversight, and law enforcement.<br>Section 7(c) directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of other relevant agencies shall develop a coordinated action plan based on the Strategy’s conclusions for mitigating the digital-asset-related illicit finance and national security risks addressed in the updated strategy. The action plan shall address the role of law enforcement and measures to increase financial services providers’ compliance with anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations related to digital asset activities.<br><span class="font-bold">II. Objective </span><br>In September 2022, the Treasury Department submitted this action plan to the White House and publicly released the report. The digital asset ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and the Department of the Treasury is committed to continuing to monitor emerging risks in partnership with other U.S. government agencies, foreign governments, and the private sector, which will inform other potential actions to mitigate these risks. Through this request for comment (RFC), Treasury is requesting input from the public to understand the public’s view on the emerging risks as well as what actions the U.S. government and Treasury Department should take to mitigate the risks. Through this RFC, Treasury also seeks to further understand how public-private collaboration may improve efforts to address the risks.<br><span class="font-bold">III. Request for Comments</span><br>Treasury welcomes input on any matter that commenters believe is relevant to Treasury’s ongoing efforts to assess the illicit finance risks associated with digital assets as well as the ongoing efforts to mitigate the risks. Commenters are encouraged to address any or all of the following questions, or to provide any other comments relevant to the development of the report. When responding to one or more of the questions below, please note in your response the number(s) of the questions to which you are responding.

Notes </span><br>The term “digital asset” refers to all CBDCs, regardless of the technology used, and to other representations of value, financial assets and instruments, or claims that are used to make payments or investments, or to transmit or exchange funds or the equivalent thereof, that are issued or represented in digital form through the use of distributed ledger technology. Some examples of digital assets include cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and CBDCs. Regardless of the label used, a digital asset may be, among other things, a security, a commodity, a derivative, or other financial product. Digital assets may be exchanged across digital asset trading platforms, including centralized and decentralized finance platforms, or through peer-to-peer technologies.<br>The term “virtual asset” refers to a subset of digital assets that does not include CBDCs or representations of other financial assets, such as digitized representations of existing securities or deposits.<br>The term “virtual asset service provider” as defined by FATF, means any natural or legal person who is not covered elsewhere under the FATF Recommendations, and as a business conducts one or more of the following activities or operations for or on behalf of another natural or legal person:<br>i. exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies;&lt;br&gt;ii. exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets;&lt;br&gt;iii. transfer of virtual assets;&lt;br&gt;iv. safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments enabling control over virtual assets; and&lt;br&gt;v. participation in and provision of financial services related to an issuer’s offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.<br>Scott Rembrandt,<br>Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, U.S. Department of the Treasury.<hr><br>Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets; Request for Comment | <a class="link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/20/2022-20279/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment" target="_blank">www.federalregister.gov</a>, <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/lM2oq" target="_blank">archive.is</a>, <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220922112324/https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/09/20/2022-20279/ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets-request-for-comment" target="_blank">archive.org</a><br>Also in PDF: <a class="link" href="treasury-taking-public-comments-on-risks-posed-by-cryptocurrency/documents/pdf.html" target="_blank">pdf</a><hr><br>Western governments have nearly dropped the pretext of decision-making with input from the public. Every decision is presented as if you are a juvenile being told that something outside your control is happening. I do not even see why the Treasury is bothering to take comments from the public.
