Sage has also been charged with possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.­ The charges are contained in an Indictment unsealed on February 9, 2018, in United States District Court in Cedar Rapids.<br>The Indictment alleges that, on or about June 30, 2017, Lensmeyer possessed with intent to distribute carfentanil and marijuana. It further alleges that, on the same date, Sage possessed with intent to distribute carfentanil, marijuana, and cocaine, and that he possessed a firearm in furtherance of those drug crimes.<br>Evidence at a detention hearing held on February 13, 2018, showed that, in June 2017, the Tri-County Drug Enforcement Task Force conducted a search of Lensmeyer’s and Sage’s shared Cedar Falls residence. During the search, investigators seized over 800 blue pills that appeared to be prescription oxycodone pills (depicted below), over $20,000 in cash, over 30 grams of cocaine, over 600 grams of marijuana, and a loaded .32 caliber handgun. Later testing determined that the blue pills contained carfentanil. Carfentanil is a powerful narcotic that is 10,000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl.
