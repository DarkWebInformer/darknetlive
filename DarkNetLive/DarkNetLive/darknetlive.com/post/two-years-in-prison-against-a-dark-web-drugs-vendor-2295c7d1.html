The investigators gained access to the vendor's transaction history and communications that revealed that the vendor had sold drugs to buyers from Germany, Italy, and Austria. The investigators also acquired GPS data from photos used by the vendor to advertise the drugs he offered.<br>The information acquired from Europol led the Dutch investigators to the defendant's residence resulting in his arrest in April 2022. A search of the defendant's residence led to the seizure of several storage devices. Information acquired from the devices revealed that the defendant was involved in the international distribution of MDMA, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ketamine via post. The investigators also recovered records of mailing information for drug packages shipped to international addresses.<br>The defendant claimed he was not the vendor and that the evidence recovered from his home may have been left by visitors. He, however, did not provide evidence to support his claims.<br>Even though law  enforcement did not  intercept any of drug packages allegedly mailed the by the defendant, the prosecution believes the postal records prove that the defendant distributed the drugs. The defendant also spent the money he received after cashing out the <a class="link" href="../tags/Bitcoin.html" target="_blank">bitcoin</a> acquired from the drug sales. <br>In addition to the two years in prison, the prosecution asked the court to order the defendant to pay a fine of  40,000 euros.</div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
