He delivered drug packages to their buyers.<br>In June 2019, Buckett failed to pay rent and his landlord got into the flat forcefully. The landlord reportedly found drugs and drug paraphernalia. He also found that Buckett kept handwritten notes of how he would set up a drug trafficking empire.<br>The ivestigators arrested Buckett on July 29, 2020, on a boat he had turned into the center of his drug trafficking operation. Norton and Petherick were arrested the next day. <br>The fourth defendant in the case, 32-year-old Joseph Strachan was arrested on August 13, 2020, after the investigators established that Buckett had purchased the vendor account from him.<br>Strachan was found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine and diazepam and was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years.<br>Norton pleaded guilty to conspiring in the distribution of cocaine and was sentenced to two years and six months in prison.<br>Petherick pleaded guilty to conspiring in the distribution of MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, and diazepam. He was sentenced to four and a half years behind bars. <br>Buckett pleaded guilty to conspiring in the distribution of MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, and diazepam.
