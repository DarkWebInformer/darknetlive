Investigations by the National Crime Agency (NCA) in cooperation with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) revealed that Rahman purchased the drugs through the dark web and had them shipped to various addresses including Daymond's and Arnold's residences.<br>Rahman would then resell the drugs via an undisclosed vendor profile on dark web marketplaces. The investigators intercepted 39 packages mailed by the defendants between 29 June and July 2020.<br><img src="../images/muninar-rahman-4c5ccf70.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Mubinar Rahman</p><br>The investigators arrested Rahman in July 2020. Messages acquired following the takedown of EncroChat led to the identification and arrest of Daymond and Arnold in April 2021.<br>Investigations into the drug trafficking operation led to the seizure of a total of 90 kilograms of MDMA, 134 kilograms of amphetamine, and more than 6,000 Xanax and Valium tabs. The investigators believe the drugs were worth more than £4.3 million.<br>Dymond and Arnold pleaded guilty to importing and exporting MDMA. They also admitted to being involved in the distribution of class A, B, and C drugs.<br>The defense attorneys told the court that Daymond worked as a taxi driver during the pandemic and got involved in the operation due to financial difficulties. Arnold had a drug use problem that led to him being indebted to Rahman. He was forced to work for Rahman to clear the debt.<br>Judge Timothy Gittins presided over the sentencing hearing and sentenced Daymond to six years in prison. He sentenced Arnold to five years and four months in prison.<br><p class="p-2 bg-gray-200 w-full"><span class="font-bold">Quote:Judge Gittins</span><br>You fall to be sentenced for your part in a substantial, professional operation to supply class A, B, and C drugs across the country and, indeed, the wider world.
