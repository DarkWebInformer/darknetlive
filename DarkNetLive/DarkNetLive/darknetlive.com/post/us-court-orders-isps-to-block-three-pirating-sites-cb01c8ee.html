The plaintiffs are three Jewish companies “<a class="link" href="https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-orders-every-isp-in-the-united-states-to-block-illegal-streaming-sites-220502/" target="_blank">related</a>” to Moshe Edery, the co-founder of Screen iL: United King Film Distribution, DBS Satellite Services, and Hot Communication. The defendants are the Jewish pirate streaming services Israel-tv.com, Israel.tv, and Sdarot.tv.<br><img src="../images/chainalysis-lsd-46288574.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Sdarot.tv is apparently a top streaming site in Israel.</p><br><br>The lawsuits are typical copyright cases. In short, the operators of the streaming sites violated copyright laws by hosting the plaintiff’s content.<br>Plaintiffs transmit their programming in an encrypted form, either as cable television transmission or via satellite transmission, and Defendants’ various services and hardware permit end-user consumers to bypass the Plaintiffs’ encryption to view Plaintiffs’ content.<br><br>Defendants have gone to great lengths to conceal themselves and their ill-gotten proceeds from Plaintiffs’ and this court’s detection, including by using multiple false identities and addresses associated with their operations and purposely-deceptive contact information for the infringing Website<br><br>However, the permanent injunctions in the judgments are the first of their kind in copyright cases. In 2011 and 2012, legislators fought over the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), which included provisions for ordering ISPs to block pirate sites. Large organizations and companies, including Google and Wikipedia, protested SOPA. As a result, the House Judiciary Committee postponed the bill. As TorrentFreak pointed out, the judgment revealed that courts could already force ISPs to block access to pirating sites. Outside of the expansion of criminal law to include prison sentences for the streaming of pirated content, SOPA’s significant elements meant very little.<br>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that <span class="font-bold">all ISPs</span> (including without limitation those set forth in Exhibit B hereto) and any other ISPs providing services in the United States <span class="font-bold">shall block access to the Website at any domain address known today</span> (including but not limited to those set forth in Exhibit A hereto) <span class="font-bold">or to be used in the future</span> by the Defendants (“Newly-Detected Websites”) <span class="font-bold">by any technological means available</span> on the ISPs’ systems.
