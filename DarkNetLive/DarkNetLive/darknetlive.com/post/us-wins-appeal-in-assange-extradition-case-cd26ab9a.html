US lawyers assured the High Court that Assange would not face SAMs while in US custody. The High Court accepted these assurances.<br><a class="link" href="https://archive.md/U5DDh" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:<br>A special administrative measure (SAM) is a process under United States law (28 CFR 501.3; see also USAM title 9 chapter 24 — Requests for Special Confinement Conditions) whereby the United States Attorney General may direct the United States Bureau of Prisons to use “special administrative measures” regarding housing of and correspondence and visitors to specific inmates. It includes prisoners awaiting or being tried, as well as those convicted, when it is alleged there is a “substantial risk that a prisoner’s communications or contacts with persons could result in death or serious bodily injury to persons, or substantial damage to property that would entail the risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons.” Such measures are used to prevent acts of violence or terrorism or disclosure of classified information.<br><br>The law is considered particularly controversial because it permits monitoring of attorney-client communications of designated prisoners. Initiated in November 2001, the Department of Justice considered this an expansion of an existing regulation. Formerly it was only allowed through a court order. It specified that information protected by attorney-client privilege could not be used for prosecution; however, communications related to ongoing or contemplated illegal acts was not covered."<br><br>It seems unlikely that Assange will end up anywhere other than ADX Florence, USP Florence High, or a similar federal institution. At ADX Florence, inmates are kept in a small cell for 23 hours a day. Inmates in the institution’s Unit H are subjected to SAMs.<br>[img=]Although mainstream media reporters operatng as an extension of the US government might deserve ____, Assange does not deserve such a cell.[/img]<br><br>It has been <a class="link" href="us-wins-appeal-in-assange-extradition-case/documents/psych.html" target="_blank">established</a> that such isolation <a class="link" href="https://archive.md/yWFw1" target="_blank">causes psychological harm</a>, at a minimum. In animal studies, such isolation has atrophied the brain. One researcher, neurologist and animal behavior scholar Michael Zigmond, reported that mice in isolation demonstrate a “decrease in the anatomical complexity of the brain (including fewer connections between nerve cells and even fewer nerve cells) and a decrease in the number of blood vessels in the brain.”<br><img src="../images/dox3-69223062.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A member of London’s Metropolitan Police demonstrated poor OPSEC while standing outside the Ecuadorian embassy.

The US government wants Assange dead. When Assange was staying at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, US government officials discussed kidnapping or assassinating Assange, according to <a class="link" href="https://archive.md/2sX3Q" target="_blank">a Yahoo News investigation</a>.
