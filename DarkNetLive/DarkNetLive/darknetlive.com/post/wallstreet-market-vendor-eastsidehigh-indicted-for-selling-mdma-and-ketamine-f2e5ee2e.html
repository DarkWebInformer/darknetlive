Court documents revealed that the United States Postal Inspection Service had launched an investigation into EastSideHigh in June 2018.<br>Investigators learned that the suspected drug dealers had been dropping packages off at Post Offices and Post Office drop boxes throughout Massachusetts. Postal Inspectors also learned that the three men had access to a storage unit in Stoughton—the location where the EastSideHigh products were being manufactured.<br>In March 2019, undercover law enforcement officers reached an agreement with EastSideHigh; they would exchange a certain amount of cash for $150,000 in bitcoin. With many cryptocurrency exchanges cracking down on illicit income, some vendors have been forced to find new ways to convert their cryptocurrency to cash. Many recent darkweb vendor busts have involved a similar tactic. During operation Dark Gold, law enforcement posed as a darkweb money launderer and collected the addresses of the vendors exchanging bitcoin for cash.<br><br><br><br>On March 27, EastSideHigh and the undercover law enforcement officers arranged a meeting at a Hampton Inn hotel. Law enforcement officers conducted surveillance on the three suspects throughout the day and determined that Pires and Le would be conducting the transaction at the hotel but McCall would be working at the storage unit. After pulling into the hotel parking lot, Le entered the hotel and Pires waited outside. “Le used his mobile phone to access hit Bitcoin wallet and electronically transferred $200,000 worth of Bitcoin to an undercover Bitcoin wallet," according to an affidavit.<br><img src="../images/EastSideHigh-Wallstreet-Profile-84240092.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">EastSideHigh Vendor Account</p><br><br>After transferring the funds, officers entered the room and arrested Le.
