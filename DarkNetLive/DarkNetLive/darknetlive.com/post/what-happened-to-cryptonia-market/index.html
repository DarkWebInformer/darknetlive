Cryptonia Market administrators provided very little information about the downtime and remained completely silent until the ninth day when they posted a signed message on the Cryptonia Market forums.<br>In the message, the marketplace staff blamed “tamper protection on one of [their] servers” for the downtime. The tamper protection allegedly triggered a shutdown. More surprisingly, though, the staff wrote that they had already planned to shut down “for a couple months” due to staffing issues. They indicated that the <a class="link" href="../italian-authorities-seized-berlusconi-market/index.html" target="_blank">recent seizure of Berlusconi Market</a> and disappearance (exit scam) of <a class="link" href="../why-is-samsara-market-down/index.html" target="_blank">SamSara Market</a> had overloaded their staff members.<br>This is not unlike the events that preceded the Hansa Market shutdown; after law enforcement had seized the largest marketplace at the time, Alphabay, users flocked to Hansa Market. They had to temporarily shut down registrations. The influx surprised even the law enforcement agencies secretly running the marketplace (and their operation relied on <a class="link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/hansa-dutch-police-sting-operation/" target="_blank">users switching to Hansa</a> in the wake of the Alphabay seizure).<br><br>In the message, the administration explained that migration to a new server would take time. They would instead end operations for the time being to “disburse funds the their rightful owners.” After dispersing all remaining funds, the market will enter a so-called “hiatus mode” until the market re-opens in 2020. The “hiatus mode” will allow “multisig users to get their tx hexes.”<br>The message indicated that the market would re-open in 2020 as the same market. One line in the message hints at what could be an alternate outcome. “We hope to see you at our next market,” the administration wrote at the end of the message.<br>Dark.Fail wrote the following <a class="link" href="https://nitter.net/DarkDotFail/status/1197596058676805633#m" target="_blank">in a tweet</a> about the market on November 21.<br>Cryptonia’s login page is back online but displays “Internal connection error. Please contact support.” when a login is attempted.<br><br>This reminds me of Berlusconi’s CAPTCHA errors for days following their arrest<br><img src="../../images/ddf-cryptonia-20110851.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The Faulty Login Page | Dark.Fail</p><br>Users on a number of forums have discussed the possibility of an exit scam as well as the possibility that law enforcement had seized the market or arrested the market’s administrators. Some users suspect that the proposed reimbursement of buyers and sellers is simply a trap to collect more Bitcoin addresses. There is no evidence to support this rumor unless one counts the random Envoy or Avengers users claiming they “knew Cryptonia was a honeypot all along” as a form of evidence. Dark.Fail’s warnings about the similarities between <a class="link" href="../../markets/cryptonia-market/index.html" target="_blank">Cryptonia Market</a> (in its current state) and a number of seized markets is the most reasonable statement concerning possible law enforcement involvement.<br><br>History repeats itself and this is no exception to the rule. <a class="link" href="../cgmc-silently-shut-down/index.html" target="_blank">CGMC is the only recent market</a> to shut down and allow all users to withdraw their Bitcoin. One could make a case for Dream; the administrator of Dream Market provided users with a warning and ample time to withdraw funds before ending operations. When <a class="link" href="../dream-market-is-shutting-down/index.html" target="_blank">Dream finally shut down</a>, a number of users cashed out. Others claimed they were unable to withdraw funds.<br>No normal market would return funds to their users in such a situation. Cryptopia certainly went their own way though and operated much differently than the majority of popular marketplaces. They appeared to value security above all else. Perhaps they value integrity as well.<br>Some users on the <a class="link" href="../../forums/avengers/index.html" target="_blank">Darknet Avengers</a> forum allegedly received payments from Cryptonia, according to posts in <a class="link" href="http://avengersdutyk3xf.onion/thread-19062-page-4.html" target="_blank">a recent thread</a>. Others, in the same thread, have not heard or received anything. There is likely a backlog of support tickets that would cause such a delay in resolving individual cases. But that backlog would only matter if the market planned on reimbursing users.<img src="../../images/Christopher-Bania-Darkweb-Vendor1-42291129.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">A Vendor on DN Avengers Allegedly Refunded by Cryptonia</p><br>The message body is pasted below.

It was caused by a tamper protection on one of our servers which led to the shutdown of our backend. For opsec reasons we cannot disclose more. The important thing is that our security measures worked and all the funds on escrow are safe.<br>The bad news is that we already had plans to close shop for a couple months due to being short-handed. Recent events have made matters worst. To bring the market back up safely we must migrate our entire infrastructure to new servers, that would mean at least a week before we can re-open. Instead we have decided to do our best to disburse the funds the their rightful owners as follows:<br><br><li>Unshipped orders will be refunded to buyers</li><li>Shipped orders will be finalized and paid to vendors</li><li>Disputed orders will be split 50/50</li><br>We hope that this way most of the funds will go to their rightful owners, and we ask our users to do the right thing in the few cases where it doesn’t. After all payments are sent the market will re-open on “hiatus mode” to allow multisig users to get their tx hexes and profiles accessed. It will remain in hiatus mode until we re-open in 2020.<br>We realize this is a huge inconvenience and we have done the best that we can under the circumstances. We wish you all a happy xmas and we hope to see you at our next market.<br>Regards,<br>The Cryptonia Market Team<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div><script data-cfasync="false" src="../../cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script></body>
