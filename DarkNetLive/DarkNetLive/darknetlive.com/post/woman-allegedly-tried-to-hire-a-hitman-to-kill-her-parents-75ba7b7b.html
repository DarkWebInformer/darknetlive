The defendant had already pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges at a previous hearing. Magistrate James Stewart remanded the defendant into custody for a hearing on May 19 on trial-related details.<br><img src="../images/num1-25289185.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The hitman site in question is gone. The site pictured is a nearly identical replacement.</p><br><br>The investigation began in October 2020 after a journalist contacted Australian Capital Territory Policing about a murder-for-hire plot. The journalist provided police with evidence that someone in Canberra had agreed to <a class="link" href="../tags/murder-for-hire/index.html" target="_blank">pay a hitman</a> $20,000 to kill two people. Investigators believe she had only paid $6,000 out of the agreed $20,000 contract.<br>According to police, the defendant entered her parents’ house when they were out and transferred $15,000 from her parents’ bank account into a bank account they shared with the defendant. Later she moved the stolen money to her bank account.<br>On September 24, 2020, the defendant allegedly used the stolen money to buy $6,000 in Bitcoin. She then sent $6,000 in Bitcoin to the administrator of the darkweb murder-for-hire site “The Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace.”<br><img src="../images/serv-82867663.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">The Sinaloa Cartel Marketplace now directs visitors to this directory of hitman sites.</p><br><br>“Having trouble using the shop function to submit job inquiry, so will do it here. Willing to pay $20,000AUD to have this done as soon as possible. 2 individuals, death by accident if at all possible,” she wrote in a message to the site administrator, “Juan.” Police alleged that she sent Juan the names and addresses of her parents. “I require this job to be done ASAP.”<br>In October 2020, police interviewed the parents. The police learned that their children would be entitled to an equal share of their 8 million dollar estate if they died.<br><img src="../images/online-67567948.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Conspicuously, the sites operated by the site owner are the top hitman sites.</p><br><br>On December 7, 2020, police interviewed the defendant and searched her home. She denied knowing anything about the darkweb or Bitcoin. <a class="link" href="australian-woman-paid-a-hitman-to-murder-her-parents/index.html" target="_blank">Police arrested her later that day</a>. Prosecutors have charged the defendant with two counts of attempted murder, two counts of inciting murder, theft, and burglary.<br>In her most recent hearing, which took place remotely, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the two counts of inciting murder. She already pleaded guilty to the other charges.<br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
