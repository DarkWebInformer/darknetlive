Means sentenced Hyun Ji Martin, 40, to 151 months in federal prison. At a previous hearing, Martin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. According to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E. Meacham, Martin sold gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) on the darkweb.<br><img src="../images/hunt-03314050.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">Martin's case was apparently part of the so-called Operation Dark HunTor</p><br><br>“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will not stop in pursuing those who wish to flood our streets with dangerous drugs,” said Thomas Noyes, Inspector in Charge of the Postal Inspection Service’s Fort Worth Division. “This sentencing represents our commitment to safeguarding the mail from illicit drug trafficking and bringing those responsible to justice. We thank all those who helped in achieving this outcome, including North Texas Parcel Task Force members, the USPS-OIG, DEA, HSI, CBP and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of Texas. "<br>According to court documents, the investigation into Martin began in March 2020. Police identified Martin as a suspected drug dealer during an unrelated investigation into someone else at a Post Office in Texas. During the surveillance at the Post Office, investigators observed Martin dropping off packages “which were characteristic of those related to the distribution of narcotics utilizing the darkweb.” <a class="link" href="../taskforces/ntptf/index.html" target="_blank">The North Texas Parcel Task Force</a> members ran Martin’s license plate and identified her as a suspect.<br>In May 2020, law enforcement officers intercepted a package of methamphetamine sent by a known drug supplier. The package was addressed to a hotel where investigators had seen Martin’s vehicle. During the investigation, officers observed several similar packages shipped by the known meth supplier to Martin at the same hotel.<br><img src="../images/hdr-05866466.jpg"><p class="text-center text-gray-500">'date rape' ok</p><br><br>Later, at the Valley Ranch Post Office, officers observed Martin enter the Post Office with a large tub of USPS mailers. After she dropped the packages off at the Post Office, investigators seized two of the packages. After opening them, investigators found 208 ml of GHB inside contact lens solution bottles. In February 2021, Martin dropped off more packages at the same Post Office under police surveillance. After seizing and opening a package, police officers found 330 ml of GHB in contact lens solution bottles.<br>On June 3, 2021, officers executed a federal search warrant at Martin’s residence. They found GHB and GBL, methamphetamine, USPS shipping, and packaging supplies, contact lens solution bottles, mylar bags, and a conversion lab to convert GBL to GHB.<br>Officers interviewed Martin regarding her drug trafficking activities. She advised officers that she orders GBL from China, converts some of the GBL to GHB, and sells both GBL and GHB on the darkweb. She also said she purchased methamphetamine from a vendor on the darkweb for personal use.<br>“Throughout the investigation, TFOs were able to determine that MARTIN is the individual mailing USPS parcels containing narcotics from multiple post offices around the DFW area, in addition to receiving packages containing narcotics. To date, outbound mailings associated with the MARTIN DTO are estimated to be over 1,600 throughout the United States.<br><br>Court documents did not identify Martin’s vendor account.<hr><br>Irving Woman Sentenced to 12+ Years for Selling Date-Rape Drug | , <a class="link" href="https://archive.ph/YqSez" target="_blank">archive.is</a>, <a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220815194202/https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndtx/pr/irving-woman-sentenced-12-years-selling-date-rape-drug" target="_blank">archive.org</a><br>complaint <a class="link" href="texas-woman-sentenced-for-selling-ghb-on-the-darkweb/documents/complaint.html" target="_blank">pdf</a><br></div></main><div class="footer"><div><label class="btn-donate" for="donate">Donate</label><a class="link-blk" href="../pgp.txt" target="_blank">PGP Key</a><a class="link-blk" href="../mirrors.txt" target="_blank">Mirrors</a><a class="link-blk" href="../canary.txt" target="_blank">Canary</a><a class="link-blk" href="../about.html" target="_blank">Contact</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.xml">RSS</a><a class="link-blk" href="../atom.xml">Atom</a><a class="link-blk" href="../index.json">JSON</a></div><hr/><p>DarkNetLive&copy;2023</p></div><input id="donate" type="checkbox" hidden=""/><div class="donate"><div class="outer"><h2>Donate</h2><label for="donate">[&times;]</label><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-btc.png"/><div><label>Bitcoin(BTC):</label><p readonly="">bc1q3x54q4arhut3tgat90cxdhfjtdpa0ermy0qshz</p></div></div><div class="inner"><img src="../qr-xmr.png"/><div><label>Monero(XMR):</label><p readonly="">866BTBpKj16MeWdGjvSRwm2CfEQfUitzQQmFYoCna6F5fw9mCBzXw3sfNUo4R7MnLsPBhTjurrt8DYjBYPo3ZqdxKP6eC5f</p></div></div></div></div></body>
