I provide CTI from the #DarkWeb & #Clearnet. Ransomware, Darknet Markets, Threat Alerts, Breaches, and more! Inform your infosec team, if data has been exposed!

X Subscriptions are Pending X's review. Lots to get out of it for only $5.00/month:

- New Darknet Market announcements when announced, with Onion URL. This allows you to provide Cyber Threat Intelligence on markets.
- Known Vendors that have been Established and updates as new vendors get established.
- Known Scammers on Darknet Markets and updates to new ones as I get them.
- Dark Web Onions that are very interesting, that no one has really heard of.
